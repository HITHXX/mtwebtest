<seg id="1">These 8 tips could help make your home environment more thinning</seg>
<seg id="2">Your house may be a threat to your figure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Add it to the list, cushioned between those extra slices of pizza and forgetting to work out--because experts say the way you design and maintain your home could play a role in whether you pack on the pounds or keep them off.</seg>
<seg id="4">&quot;You can make your environment work for you instead of against you,&quot; says Dawn Jackson Blatner, dietitian and author of The Flexitarian Diet.</seg>
<seg id="5">&quot;There are ways to use your house to successfully watch your weight, rather than relying solely on willpower.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="6">Continue to the next slide to see the 8 ways to turn your home into part of your diet plan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Open the drapes and turn up the lights</seg>
<seg id="8">Dark environments are more likely to foster binge eating, say researchers at the University of California--Irvine.</seg>
<seg id="9">That&apos;s because people are often less inhibited and less self-conscious when they&apos;re in dimly lit places--and so more likely to inhale heaps of food with the flair of a speed eater.</seg>
<seg id="10">The researchers describe darkness as a &quot;high-risk environment,&quot; so if your home doesn&apos;t emphasize window light, invest in some decorative lamps and flood the place with brightness.</seg>

<seg id="11">Tornadoes devastate South, killing at least 290</seg>
<seg id="12">Firefighters searched one splintered pile after another for survivors Thursday, combing the remains of houses and neighborhoods pulverized by the nation&apos;s deadliest tornado outbreak in almost four decades.</seg>
<seg id="13">At least 290 people were killed across six states -- more than two-thirds of them in Alabama, where large cities bore the half-mile-wide scars the twisters left behind.</seg>
<seg id="14">The death toll from Wednesday&apos;s storms seems out of a bygone era, before Doppler radar and pinpoint satellite forecasts were around to warn communities of severe weather.</seg>
<seg id="15">Residents were told the tornadoes were coming up to 24 minutes ahead of time, but they were just too wide, too powerful and too locked onto populated areas to avoid a horrifying body count.</seg>
<seg id="16">&quot;These were the most intense super-cell thunderstorms that I think anybody who was out there forecasting has ever seen,&quot; said meteorologist Greg Carbin at the National Weather Service&apos;s Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Okla.</seg>
<seg id="17">&quot;If you experienced a direct hit from one of these, you&apos;d have to be in a reinforced room, storm shelter or underground to survive,&quot; Carbin said.</seg>
<seg id="18">The storms seemed to hug the interstate highways as they barreled along like runaway trucks, obliterating neighborhoods or even entire towns from Tuscaloosa to Bristol, Va. One family rode out the disaster in the basement of a funeral home, another by huddling in a tanning bed.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Concord, a small town outside Birmingham that was ravaged by a tornado, Randy Guyton&apos;s family got a phone call from a friend warning them to take cover.</seg>
<seg id="20">They rushed to the basement garage, piled into a Honda Ridgeline and listened to the roar as the twister devoured the house in seconds.</seg>
<seg id="21">Afterward, they could see outside through the shards of their home and scrambled out.</seg>

<seg id="22">Superman: I&apos;m renouncing my US citizenship</seg>
<seg id="23">Superman has started a stir with a bold declaration he intends to renounce his U.S. citizenship in a move aimed at giving him more global clout and authority.</seg>
<seg id="24">The decision is made in a short story in &quot;Action Comics&quot; No. 900.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has caused consternation online among readers who liken the Man of Steel&apos;s declaration to go before the United Nations and &quot;inform them I am renouncing my citizenship&quot; to abandoning the ideals of truth, justice and the American way.</seg>
<seg id="26">DC Comics said Thursday the Kryptonian superhero isn&apos;t abandoning his adopted country.</seg>
<seg id="27">It says he&apos;s putting a global focus on his never-ending battle against evil and trying to keep a world that&apos;s not his safe.</seg>

<seg id="28">Is education the next bubble?</seg>
<seg id="29">Higher learning is just an overpriced, speculative investment that typically rewards graduates with dismal career prospects, says billionaire Peter Thiel.</seg>
<seg id="30">Billionaire libertarian businessman Peter Thiel, the founder and former CEO of PayPal, is perhaps best known as the venture capitalist who gave Facebook the angel investment it needed to really get started.</seg>
<seg id="31">But, increasingly, he&apos;s getting attention for his controversial views on higher learning.</seg>
<seg id="32">Last year, he launched the Thiel fellowship, which gives grants as large as $100,000 to 20 tech entrepreneurs who drop out of college by age 20 to pursue their own ideas.</seg>
<seg id="33">Then, in a National Review interview earlier this year, Thiel said that higher education is a &quot;bubble in the classic sense,&quot; because education is &quot;overpriced,&quot; something people have &quot;an intense belief in,&quot; and an investment that&apos;s unlikely, in the majority of cases, to have a positive return.</seg>
<seg id="34">He made the point again last week at TechCrunch.</seg>
<seg id="35">Given the &quot;financial disaster&quot; of student loan debt surpassing credit card debt, does Thiel have a point?</seg>
<seg id="36">No, education isn&apos;t about returns on an investment: The concept of the education bubble is based on horrifying, false logic, says Freddie deBoer at L&apos;Hote.</seg>
<seg id="37">&quot;To see an education, college or otherwise, as merely a way to increase the amount of money you make is a terrible corruption and fundamentally unsustainable.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="38">Increasing earning potential was never meant to be the sole purpose of education, and if it&apos;s reduced to that, we&apos;re all in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="39">&quot;Yet another casualty&quot;</seg>
<seg id="40">Well, college is overpriced: College has gotten too expensive, with state governments cutting aid to public universities, says E.D. Kain in Forbes.</seg>
<seg id="41">But let&apos;s not abandon institutions of higher learning.</seg>
<seg id="42">If needed, we should raise taxes to make public universities more affordable.</seg>
<seg id="43">&quot;Yes, education costs money. But that money should not fall squarely on the heads of middle class kids who are forced to take out tens of thousands in debt just to attend school.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="44">&quot;A college education should not result in crushing debt&quot;</seg>
<seg id="45">And grad school is a particularly poor investment: College is still a good decision for most young Americans, but I can&apos;t say the same about grad school, says Conor Friedersdorf at The Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="46">Grad school has become a socially acceptable way to drink beer, read, and go into massive debt in your 20s.</seg>
<seg id="47">&quot;Upper-middle-class Americans tend to overvalue the non-financial benefits of grad school.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="48">Thiel&apos;s wrong about a lot.</seg>
<seg id="49">But at least he&apos;s &quot;challenging the cultural assumptions that cause a lot of people to make bad life decisions.&quot;</seg>

<seg id="50">Why do smart kids grow up to be heavier drinkers?</seg>
<seg id="51">A pair of new studies suggests a correlation between intelligence and a thirst for alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="52">What&apos;s the connection?</seg>
<seg id="53">Don&apos;t worry, all that excessive drinking is just a sign of your intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="54">According to two long-term studies -- one American, one British --  there&apos;s a correlation between smarts and a thirst for alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="55">The &quot;more intelligent children in both studies grew up to drink alcohol more frequently and in greater quantities than less intelligent children,&quot; says Liz Day at Discover.</seg>
<seg id="56">Why might this be the case?</seg>
<seg id="57">It&apos;s all about evolution: Drinking alcohol was &quot;unintentional, accidental, and haphazard until about 10,000 years ago,&quot; says Satoshi Kanazawaat at Psychology Today.</seg>
<seg id="58">Smart people are generally early adopters and, in the context of human history, &quot;the alcohol and the method of consumption are both evolutionarily novel.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="59">&quot;Why intelligent people drink more alcohol&quot;</seg>
<seg id="60">Alcohol makes up for boring early years: &quot;I&apos;m surprised&quot; by the findings, says Joanne Hinkel at The Frisky, so &quot;here&apos;s my pop-psychology theory&quot; to explain it: &quot;All that studying in childhood repressed kids so much that they&apos;re still trying to compensate well into adulthood for all that fun they missed.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="61">Granted, that&apos;s just a theory.</seg>
<seg id="62">&quot;Brain types booze more -- are you surprised?&quot;</seg>
<seg id="63">Drinking is the only way to deal with morons: Smart people &quot;booze so we can tolerate everyone else,&quot; says Greg at Food &amp; Wine Blog.</seg>
<seg id="64">When sober, we tend to &quot;take people&apos;s responses at literal face value.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="65">But after a few drinks, &quot;we can relax a bit, stop being so anal with semantics and let comments slide a bit.&quot;</seg>

<seg id="66">Facebook Deals: A Groupon killer?</seg>
<seg id="67">The social-networking giant now offers daily shopping deals.</seg>
<seg id="68">Can the new program overtake Groupon and LivingSocial -- and make Facebook a force in commerce?</seg>
<seg id="69">Facebook on Tuesday started offering users in five U.S. cities daily shopping deals, becoming the latest competitor to enter an already &quot;crowded market&quot; dominated by Groupon and LivingSocial.</seg>
<seg id="70">Facebook is betting its popularity and its role in connecting people will help it create &quot;a more compelling service than rivals,&quot; says Miguel Helft in The New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="71">Instead of focusing on items like discounted clothing, Facebook Deals with be geared toward travel, concerts, wine tastings, and other activities friends can do together.</seg>
<seg id="72">Does Facebook&apos;s program -- now available in Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, San Diego, and San Francisco -- have what it takes to be a Groupon-killer?</seg>
<seg id="73">Yes, Facebook&apos;s social approach makes sense: It&apos;s smart for Facebook to emphasize social experiences rather than just compete to offer the deepest discounts, says E.B. Boyd in Fast Company.</seg>
<seg id="74">Businesses can&apos;t keep cutting their prices to attract new customers, so many daily deal services will soon &quot;start to crumble.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="75">Focusing on things friends can do together &quot;fits with Facebook&apos;s core mission and core strength.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="76">&quot;Facebook Deals out-groups Groupon&quot;</seg>
<seg id="77">Yes, because Facebook has what retailers want: Facebook&apos;s biggest edge is the vast collection of &quot;structured, verified, meaningful demographic and taste data&quot; it can share with marketers, says Marshall Kirkpatrick at ReadWriteWeb.</seg>
<seg id="78">That information can be used to perfect sales pitches, something retailers will love.</seg>
<seg id="79">Plus, Deals will create &quot;real-world, non-virtual&quot; uses for Facebook&apos;s online currency called Credits.</seg>
<seg id="80">&quot;Somebody call Congress and the Federal Reserve,&quot; because Credits are about to become a real force.</seg>
<seg id="81">&quot;Facebook Deals launches tonight &amp; Groupon doesn&apos;t stand a chance&quot;</seg>
<seg id="82">No, Groupon still has an edge: Facebook is going to kill Groupon?</seg>
<seg id="83"> Sorry, &quot;I&apos;m not buying it,&quot; says Larry Dignan at ZDNet.</seg>
<seg id="84"> Groupon has a solid head start, and its successful business model isn&apos;t as easy to replicate as people think.</seg>
<seg id="85"> Facebook may be bigger, but it &quot;doesn&apos;t have the focus on coupons or local business relationships&quot; to knock off Groupon or LivingSocial.</seg>
<seg id="86"> And social network addicts might find coupons, or commerce in general, &quot;annoying in the context of Facebook.&quot;</seg>

<seg id="108">Is Beyoncé making kids narcissistic?</seg>
<seg id="109">A new analysis of pop music suggests that egotism-promoting tunes are turning kids into full-blown egomaniacs.</seg>
<seg id="110">If your kids seem to be saying &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot; with excessive frequency these days, you may want to check their iPods.</seg>
<seg id="111">A new study, published in the journal Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts, analyzed the lyrics of hit songs from 1980 to 2007 and found a statistically significant trend toward narcissism and, secondarily, hostility.</seg>
<seg id="112">The &quot;us&quot;-centric songs of the 1980s, like &quot;Ebony and Ivory,&quot; have given way to &quot;me&quot;-centric lyrics like Beyonce&apos;s &quot;It&apos;s blazin&apos;, you watch me in amazement.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="113">And there&apos;s a correlation between narcissistic songs and an uptick in narcissism over time.</seg>
<seg id="114">Are Beyoncé and Co. to blame?</seg>
<seg id="115">Yes, blame the music: This spot-on study leaves you wondering, &quot;How does an entire generation become so full of itself?&quot; says Sandy Hingston in Philadelphia Magazine.</seg>
<seg id="116">You don&apos;t need a Ph.D to see a straight line from songs about &quot;I, I, I, me, me!&quot; to the jump in narcissistic college students who, in surveys, agree with statements such as, &quot;I like to look at myself in the mirror.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="117">&quot;Are today&apos;s kids narcissists?&quot;</seg>
<seg id="118">No, this doesn&apos;t prove anything: Granted, &quot;Beyoncé might be a special case when it comes to sublimating herself lyrically,&quot; but there&apos;s no shortage of great &quot;we&quot; songs today, says Maura Johnston in The Village Voice.</seg>
<seg id="119">And there was no lack of self-lovin&apos; in the &apos;80s.</seg>
<seg id="120">Madonna, anyone? Prince?</seg>
<seg id="121">Even if people are more narcissistic today, &quot;this bit of junk &apos;it was all better in the old days, wahhh&apos; research&quot; sure doesn&apos;t prove it&apos;s music&apos;s fault.</seg>
<seg id="122">&quot;Annoyed scientist wants all you narcissistic pop stars to get off his lawn&quot;</seg>
<seg id="123">These studies have gotten out of hand: This whole social-science trend of analyzing pop hits is ridiculous, says Jacob Ganz at NPR.</seg>
<seg id="124">One study claimed that lyrics with more words per sentence &quot;tended to be &apos;popular during threatening social and economic conditions.&apos;&quot;</seg>
<seg id="125">Another suggested that &quot;the popularity of simple songs with a regular beat predicts volatility in the economy.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="126">What nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="127">And this latest study confirms nothing more than the &quot;anti-youth biases&quot; of its researchers.</seg>

<seg id="128">Lara Logan breaks silence on Cairo assault</seg>
<seg id="129">Talks to Scott Pelley about sexual assault, her rescue and recovery</seg>
<seg id="130">Lara Logan feared she would die a &quot;torturous death&quot; during a sexual assault and beating she suffered at the hands of a violent mob in Egypt&apos;s Tahrir Square.</seg>
<seg id="131">In her first television interview since her ordeal two months ago, the CBS News chief foreign correspondent and &quot;60 Minutes&quot; reporter reveals what happened to her for the first time in an interview conducted by Scott Pelley.</seg>
<seg id="132">Logan&apos;s story will be broadcast on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; this Sunday, May 1 at 7 p.m. ET/PT.</seg>
<seg id="133">On Feb. 11, Logan was on assignment for &quot;60 Minutes&quot; covering Egypt&apos;s mass celebration of its revolution.</seg>
<seg id="134">With her in Tahrir Square in Cairo were her producer, Max McClellan and cameraman Richard Butler.</seg>
<seg id="135">There was also an interpreter and a former member of Britain&apos;s elite military special services acting as a bodyguard.</seg>
<seg id="136">She reported without incident for nearly an hour before her interpreter heard words in the Arabic-speaking crowd that gave him pause.</seg>
<seg id="137">He advised the team to leave, but before they could, a mob of several hundred men encircled Logan, who soon became separated from her team and bodyguard as the crowd swept her up.</seg>
<seg id="138">Logan lost contact with her colleagues for approximately 25 minutes and endured a sexual assault and beating that she feared she would not survive.</seg>
<seg id="139">&quot;There was no doubt in my mind that I was in the process of dying,&quot; she tells Pelley.</seg>
<seg id="140">&quot;I thought not only am I going to die, but it&apos;s going to be just a torturous death that&apos;s going to go on forever...&quot;</seg>
<seg id="141">Thoughts of her two young children helped reinforce her determination to survive the assault, she says, which finally ended when she was rescued by a group of Egyptian women and soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="142">The soldiers drove her and her team back to their hotel, where she was examined by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="143">She returned to the U.S. the next day and went directly into a hospital, where she was treated for four days.</seg>
<seg id="144">When Logan saw her children, &quot;I felt like I had been given a second chance that I didn&apos;t deserve...because I did that to them. I came so close to leaving them, to abandoning them,&quot; she says.</seg>
<seg id="145">Logan, who began her first full day back in her &quot;60 Minutes&quot; office Wednesday (April 27), says she is healing.</seg>
<seg id="146">&quot;I am so much stronger.&quot; She hopes her story will give courage to other victims of sexual assault, especially female reporters who fear such admissions may impact their work.</seg>
<seg id="147">In addition to Sunday&apos;s television broadcast , Logan will also appear in an interview on 60 Minutes&apos; webcast, 60MinutesOvertime.com.</seg>

<seg id="148">William and Kate&apos;s royal wedding message</seg>
<seg id="149">Prince William and his bride-to-be have extended their humble thanks, in advance, to their wedding guests in London.</seg>
<seg id="150">Britain&apos;s royal family released details Thursday of the official wedding program, which includes a written message from the young couple.</seg>
<seg id="151">&quot;We are both so delighted that you are able to join us in celebrating what we hope will be one of the happiest days of our lives,&quot; reads the statement.</seg>
<seg id="152">&quot;The affection shown to us by so many people during our engagement has been incredibly moving, and has touched us both deeply. We would live to take this opportunity to thank everyone most sincerely for their kindness.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="153">The official program is available to view at Prince William and Kate Middleton&apos;s wedding website, or through the Apple iBookstore, but to get an official hard copy, you&apos;ll have to wait until Friday morning -- and be in London.</seg>
<seg id="154">The first thing viewers see upon opening the program is the royal couple&apos;s personal message, opposite an official engagement photo.</seg>
<seg id="155">The program also reveals the royal couple&apos;s choice in wedding music, which is heavily laden with classical British compositions, including Greensleeves and a Edward Elgar composition, Serenade for Strings in E minor Op. 20.</seg>
<seg id="156">On April 29 -- wedding day -- 150,000 hard copies of the program will be available for sale in Green Park, Hyde Park, St. James&apos; Park and Trafalgar Square.</seg>
<seg id="157">According to the Palace, all proceeds from the sale of the programs will go to Prince William and Prince Harry&apos;s charitable foundation.</seg>

<seg id="474">Going &apos;green&apos; makes good business sense</seg>
<seg id="475">THE Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) Brunei hopes that local businesses and entrepreneurs will realise the significant potential of green businesses as a result of the upcoming National Environment Conference 2011 (NEC), said Lim Boon Teck, Manager Corporate Sustainability at HSBC Brunei.</seg>
<seg id="476">&quot;Based on HSBC research, global Climate Change related business or Green Business could be worth US$2 trillion ($2.45 trillion) by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="477">This is a sector with high growth potential (and) we hope through the National Environment Conference 2011, Bruneian businesses and entrepreneurs will become more aware of the significant business opportunities that are associated with low-carbon economy, climate change adaptation and Green technology,&quot; said Lim of what he hoped the NEC 2011 would deliver.</seg>
<seg id="478">Because of the anticipated threat of climate change, he added, possibly the only common sustainability risk amongst industries and companies may be environmental health.</seg>
<seg id="479">&quot;Specific sustainability risks will differ between companies.</seg>
<seg id="480">For example, sustainability risk for a water bottling company is to ensure the continual supply and quality of their water source.</seg>
<seg id="481">Their sustainability initiative may focus on the environment surrounding their water sources.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="482">This means businesses will need to consider both internal and external factors to identify their sustainability risk, he explained.</seg>
<seg id="483">HSBC Brunei has been one of the pioneer organisations in Brunei to adopt greener practices in the workplace, Lim agreed, and as such, &quot;As part of our efforts to manage the environmental impact of our business operation, we have been actively reviewing our energy and paper consumption since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="484">Results from the review and the initiatives implemented have made a positive impact on the environment and our financial bottom line.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="485">For example, he said, our energy consumption has reduced by twenty-two per cent since we opted for a new water chilled air condition system as well as an identified area where we can save up to 320 tonnes of paper and realized more than $200,000 of saving annually.</seg>
<seg id="486">&quot;Our petrol consumption has also reduced by forty-seven per cent since we changed our senior management car fleet to the more energy efficient Toyota Prius,&quot; he added.</seg>
<seg id="487">Sustainability issues will obviously differ between companies and across industries he observed, noting that an oil &amp; gas company may place emphasis on health and safety as the priority in their sustainability strategy because &quot;any unwanted incidents will impact their operation, revenue stream and may also result in adverse environmental consequences and reputations risk&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="488">HSBC&apos;s own sustainability agenda in going forward, Lim added, would have a continued focus on education for disadvantaged children and financial literacy.</seg>
<seg id="489">&quot;A highly educated population is essential for continuous economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="490">As a financial service provider, we will stand to benefit from these economic growths.</seg>
<seg id="491">In Brunei, we will continue to evaluate how we can add value to the excellent education system that has been put in place by the Brunei Government.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="492">HSBC&apos;s focus on environment awareness and education will also remain a priority, he added, noting that environmental issues requires concerted efforts from the individual, corporate and government.</seg>
<seg id="493">&quot;We hope greater awareness and education will translate to action.</seg>
<seg id="494">We will also be looking for green business opportunities locally.</seg>
<seg id="495">As countries around the world move toward low carbon economy and take climate change adaptation measure, green technology market is an area with high growth potential and we hope Bruneian businesses will be ready to capture these opportunities,&quot; he added.</seg>

<seg id="497">85 Men and 85 Women Receive Gifts from the Queen at Westminster Abbey</seg>
<seg id="498">Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, talk with The Very Rev. Dr. John Hall, Dean of Westminster, as they leave the traditional Royal Maundy Service at Westminster Abbey on her 85th birthday, April 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="499">The queen spent her morning at Westminster Abbey attending a service observing the holy week holiday, Maundy Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="500">During the ceremony, Queen Elizabeth handed out money to elders, a royal tradition that started under the reign of Charles II.</seg>
<seg id="501">The Maundy money, as it&apos;s called, was given to 170 people, 85 men and 85 women in honor of each year of Queen Elizabeth&apos;s life.</seg>
<seg id="502">At the age of 85, the birthday girl is now the oldest British monarch ever to rule.</seg>
<seg id="503">She&apos;s served as queen for 59 years, having ascended the throne when she was just 25.</seg>
<seg id="504">On Wednesday, Prince Charles set the record as longest heir apparent in British history.</seg>
<seg id="505">&quot;If she lives as long as her mother she could go another 15 years, 16 years, which will put Charles around about 78,&quot; Dickie Arbiter, former press secretary to the Queen, told the Royal Diary.</seg>

<seg id="508">Details about the targeted attack that killed the world&apos;s most wanted terrorist have emerged.</seg>
<seg id="509">On Friday, President Obama gave the order for the U.S. military to carry out the mission to take out Osama bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="510">Early Monday morning in Pakistan, about 25 special weapons forces working for the CIA descended upon the compound where bin Laden was hiding--a million dollar villa in the wealthy suburbs of Islamabad, Pakistan&apos;s capital.</seg>
<seg id="511">The suburb is a popular place for members of Pakistan&apos;s military to live.</seg>
<seg id="512">The compound was several times larger than the other homes in the area, but there was no phone or Internet service there.</seg>
<seg id="513">The people who lived in the compound burned their trash instead of leaving it on the street.</seg>
<seg id="514">The troops, mostly Navy SEALs, stormed into the building and a fire fight ensued.</seg>
<seg id="515">Reports indicate bin Laden tried to resist the attack but was killed inside the building along with one of his sons, two couriers, and a woman used as a human shield against the shots.</seg>
<seg id="516">The soldiers took bin Laden&apos;s body with them.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to Muslim custom, bin Laden has to be buried within 24 hours of his death.</seg>
<seg id="518">Officials say he is being buried at sea.</seg>

<seg id="520">Britain&apos;s Foreign Office says that the Libyan ambassador to the U.K. has been expelled from the country following attacks on the British embassy in Tripoli.</seg>
<seg id="521">A ministry spokesman says Omar Jelban left Britain on Monday evening after he was given 24 hours to leave on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="522">Foreign Secretary William Hague said Sunday he decided to expel the ambassador because Libyan authorities failed to protect foreign diplomatic missions.</seg>
<seg id="523">Angry mobs attacked Western embassies and a U.N. office in Tripoli after NATO bombed Moammar Gadhafi&apos;s family compound and killed Gadhafi&apos;s second youngest son, 29-year-old Seif al-Arab.</seg>

<seg id="524">Michael Jackson doctor Conrad Murray trial delayed</seg>
<seg id="525">The trial of the doctor accused of causing the drug overdose death of pop legend Michael Jackson has been postponed until September.</seg>
<seg id="526">In Los Angeles, lawyers for Dr Conrad Murray had asked for a delay to prepare for new prosecution witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="527">Dr Murray has pleaded not guilty to a charge of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson&apos;s June 2009 death at 50.</seg>
<seg id="528">Prosecutors say he gave him a lethal dose of a powerful anaesthetic and then failed to provide proper care.</seg>
<seg id="529">Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor said he would dismiss the prospective jurors.</seg>
<seg id="530">Prosecutors have said Dr Murray, who had been treating the singer for insomnia, administered the lethal dose of propofol, a drug typically used in a clinical setting, then tried to cover it up.</seg>
<seg id="531">Lawyers for Dr Murray have suggested in recent months that the singer gave himself the lethal dose.</seg>

<seg id="534">Tillakaratne and ex-team-mate Arjuna Ranatunga claim fixing has been common in Sri Lankan cricket since 1992.</seg>
<seg id="535">The Sri Lanka Cricket Board called on the pair to substantiate the claims and queried why they have only emerged now.</seg>
<seg id="536">Tillakaratne says he will provide the International Cricket Council with information &quot;at the appropriate time.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="537">The 43-year-old added: &quot;I made a statement to the provincial council, I said that I still maintain my stand on the allegations.</seg>
<seg id="538">&quot;After I came out with these allegations at the weekend I have been getting a lot of nuisance calls, death threats, but definitely I will expose all those who are involved in a time to come.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="539">When asked why he has not followed the established procedure of working with the ICC&apos;s anti-corruption unit, Tillakaratne replied &quot;I will do that in the days to come.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="540">Several international players including South Africa&apos;s Hansie Cronje, India&apos;s Mohammad Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja, and Pakistan&apos;s Salim Malik have been found guilty of match-fixing and served bans in the past decade, although Jadeja and Malik later had their bans quashed.</seg>
<seg id="541">Most recently, Pakistani players Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were banned for five years or more after being found guilty off corruption by the ICC.</seg>
<seg id="542">Tillakaratne played 83 tests for Sri Lanka from 1989 to 2004, scoring 4,545 runs including 11 centuries.</seg>
<seg id="543">He scored 3,789 one-day runs from 200 matches between 1986 and 2003.</seg>

<seg id="986">In South Korea, a run with a view</seg>
<seg id="987">A South Korean marathon draws 15,000 people every year to run alongside lines of blossoming cherry trees.</seg>
<seg id="988">Few marathons are as pleasantly situated as the one held in this ancient royal capital of temples and kings&apos; tombs every April when the cherry trees are in bloom.</seg>
<seg id="989">The Gyeongju Cherry Marathon, on South Korea&apos;s east coast, doesn&apos;t attract the top world-class long-distance runners, but 15,000 people sign up every year to run along a course around Bomun Lake, lined with blossoming trees.</seg>
<seg id="990">After the race, runners and walkers visit historical sites dating from the era more than a thousand years ago when Gyeongju was the capital of the kingdom of Silla.</seg>
<seg id="991">This year&apos;s marathon had &quot;a special meaning,&quot; since it came so soon after the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in March, says Charm Lee, president of the Korea Tourist Organization.</seg>
<seg id="992">The scenic setting offered relief from the stress of the disaster to Koreans and tourists alike.</seg>

<seg id="993">Citizen science: Armies of volunteers aid research</seg>
<seg id="994">Environmental scientist Chris Bowser pulled a tiny shrimp-like creature from the muck in an eel trap as teenagers in chest waders surrounded him in the rushing Fall Kill, where they were collecting transparent baby eels.</seg>
<seg id="995">&quot;This is called a scud, or amphipod,&quot; Bowser said, launching into a riff on the food chain and pollution.</seg>
<seg id="996">&quot;Are you going to eat it?&quot; a girl interrupted.</seg>
<seg id="997">&quot;What? No!&quot; Bowser snapped, then reconsidered and popped it in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="998">&quot;Tastes like shrimp seasoned with mud.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="999">Besides being a researcher in the state&apos;s Hudson River Estuary Program, Bowser leads citizen projects that collect reams of data for scientists and resource management agencies while engaging volunteers in hands-on science and teaching them something about the world around them.</seg>
<seg id="1000">His Steve Irwin-style exuberance and enthusiasm for his subject matter make Bowser an ideal leader in the rapidly expanding world of citizen science.</seg>
<seg id="1001">Once restricted mainly to counting birds -- most famously, in Audubon&apos;s 111-year-old Christmas Bird Count -- citizen science has expanded rapidly in recent years, both in number and variety of projects.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Some projects count things -- fireflies, ladybugs, frogs, herring.</seg>
<seg id="1003">Others record data on water quality, weather, flower budding and other phenomena.</seg>
<seg id="1004">Still others already have the data but need a lot of people to sort through it.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Darlene Cavalier, whose ScienceForCitizens website brings together volunteers and research projects, said she started the site when she was a graduate student writing a thesis on promoting citizen science.</seg>
<seg id="1006">The site&apos;s growth from a blog listing about 40 projects in 2006 to a busy portal with more than 400 projects in its database today mirrors the expansion of citizen science in the U.S., Cavalier said.</seg>
<seg id="1007">&quot;My goal is to get as many people as possible involved in citizen science projects,&quot; said Cavalier.</seg>
<seg id="1008">The more people learn about science and build a personal connection to research, the better they&apos;ll be able to participate in policy decisions related to science and the environment, she said.</seg>
<seg id="1009">For researchers, volunteers provide free labor and are able to complete a great deal of work in a short time if there are a lot of them.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Galaxy Zoo was launched in 2007 to enlist volunteers to classify photographs of a million galaxies.</seg>
<seg id="1011">More than 250,000 people have participated so far, providing information used in numerous peer-reviewed journal articles.</seg>
<seg id="1012">&quot;Professional science communities were a little wary of involving the public in the past because of trust issues and concerns about bad data,&quot; Cavalier said.</seg>
<seg id="1013">Better design of projects and new methods of weeding out bad data have overcome much of that concern, she said.</seg>
<seg id="1014">Janis Dickinson, director of citizen science at Cornell Lab of Ornithology, is co-author of a book soon to be published about the lab&apos;s highly regarded citizen science projects, which include Project FeederWatch, the Great Backyard Bird Count, and eBird, a global online tool where birders enter sightings into a massive database.</seg>
<seg id="1015">&quot;The book is about how we can harness the Internet to create conservation communities that are actually practicing data collection over huge and relevant geographic scales that really encompass the distributions of the organisms that we&apos;re concerned about,&quot; Dickinson said.</seg>
<seg id="1016">&quot;The Internet allowed us suddenly to be able to take in data from a broad public, now globally with eBird, and then process that data and provide tools to the public so they can visualize and manipulate the data.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1017">As citizen science has become more sophisticated, the scientific community has embraced it, Dickinson said.</seg>
<seg id="1018">&quot;Ten years ago when our researchers tried to publish they&apos;d usually get a peer reviewer who was skeptical of the data,&quot; Dickinson said.</seg>
<seg id="1019">&quot;We don&apos;t see that any more. The research associate working in my group, who did his Ph.D. working from citizen science data, submitted a paper last August that was one of the fastest accepted I&apos;ve ever seen.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1020">Bowser said researchers are becoming more accepting of volunteer-based data collection, but only if the protocols are straightforward enough and the citizens participating are trained and able to follow those protocols carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1021">&quot;This eel project is a great model for citizen science,&quot; Bowser said after wading ashore and leaving the students to their eel counting and water sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1022">&quot;For one thing, the species has a real demonstrated conservation need. We&apos;ve seen a decline in American eels -- in some populations 80 to 90 percent -- since the 1970s, and we&apos;re not sure why. The data we collect goes to the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, which wants this information.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1023">Volunteers like to know they&apos;re doing something with real value, he said.</seg>
<seg id="1024">They also like the fact that it requires a time commitment of just two months in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="1025">&quot;Also, the eel has this very compelling story,&quot; Bowser said.</seg>
<seg id="1026">&quot;They&apos;re born in the ocean in the Sargasso Sea, then travel thousands of miles as baby glass eels to swim up rivers and populate the watersheds. And they&apos;re charismatic in an underdog, Humphrey Bogart kind of way.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1027">&quot;It&apos;s good for kids to get outdoors and see what&apos;s out there,&quot; said 20-year-old Jorge Reyes-Bravo, who started working on the eel project when he was in high school and continues to volunteer now that he&apos;s in community college majoring in environmental studies.</seg>
<seg id="1028">&quot;We don&apos;t want to see species disappear. We want to figure out why they&apos;re disappearing and help them.&quot;</seg>

<seg id="1029">If &quot;America Can Do Whatever We Set Our Mind To,&quot; How Come Our Leaders Won&apos;t Set Their Minds on Jobs?</seg>
<seg id="1030">&quot;We do big things,&quot; President Obama said during his State of the Union speech in January. And, in fact, we do. Sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1031">Finding and dispatching Osama bin Laden certainly qualifies.</seg>
<seg id="1032">&quot;We are once again reminded,&quot; the president said after announcing the terrorist&apos;s death, &quot;that America can do whatever we set our mind to.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1033">But if that&apos;s true, why are our leaders so accepting of a stagnant economy?</seg>
<seg id="1034">If they really focused on the havoc it is wreaking on the lives of tens of millions of Americans, they would, in the memorable words of Richard Clarke, be running around with their hair on fire. But they&apos;re not.</seg>
<seg id="1035">Instead, we&apos;re being asked to accept years of underemployment, low growth and draconian cuts to America&apos;s social safety nets as the &quot;new normal.&quot; Or, as Bill Clinton put it in a different context, the &quot;tyranny of low expectations.&quot;</seg>

<seg id="1204">Does Microsoft&apos;s Skype Buy Mean It Finally Understands What People Want?</seg>
<seg id="1205">Does Microsoft&apos;s plan to buy Skype, a company that provides voice and video chatting services over the Internet, mean the software giant has finally figured out what consumers want?</seg>
<seg id="1206">Once the purchase is complete, Microsoft intends to add Skype&apos;s voice and video calling technology to existing devices, from smartphones to gaming systems to email, betting that these features will help Microsoft quickly regain lost ground in both boardrooms and bedrooms.</seg>
<seg id="1207">But is Skype all that stands between Microsoft and a killer, must-have gadget?</seg>
<seg id="1208">Or is Microsoft in danger of once again missing the mark with a costly blunder that was conceived by executives and PR gurus without adequate consideration for the consumer?</seg>
<seg id="1209">While analysts predict that Skype&apos;s video conferencing features will make Microsoft&apos;s enterprise products a favorite among corporate IT departments, they say Skype-enhanced consumer gadgets are less likely to take off, suggesting Microsoft is still having trouble putting its finger on the pulse of its users.</seg>
<seg id="1210">&quot;It may very well be the case that Skype is bringing powerful technology that can influence Microsoft&apos;s success in the corporate space, but in the consumer space it&apos;s hard to see this as an asset they can leverage to warrant the investment they&apos;ve made,&quot; said Forrester analyst Charles Golvin, who dismissed the idea that Skype would be a gamechanger for Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Microsoft desperately needs an iPad -- a hit product that will sell millions, inspire fanatical devotees, and have people lining up before dawn -- and despite sinking billions into its search engine, Bing, and smartphone software, Windows Phone 7, it has yet to woo consumers away from Apple and Google in meaningful numbers (though its success with gamer favorite Kinect suggests potential).</seg>
<seg id="1212">Microsoft has had a mixed record when it comes to anticipating what people want.</seg>
<seg id="1213">Its Kin smartphone was pulled from shelves less than two months after it launched.</seg>
<seg id="1214">Its Zune MP3 player has never been a credible rival to the iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1215">And Microsoft has spent billions on its latest mobile phone software, Windows Phone 7, but, by the end of 2010, had sold only around 2 million phones running the operating system, a paltry figure next to the over 14 million phones Apple sold in the final quarter of 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Microsoft has kept silent on how many of those phones users have actually switched on.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Microsoft has confirmed that Microsoft&apos;s Windows Phone software and Xbox gaming system will be among the consumer products to support Skype functionalities, and Skype&apos;s presence on these two devices is likely to net vastly different results.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Experts say Microsoft will have a tough time convincing users to trade their iPhones and Androids for Skype-enabled Microsoft phones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Not only is Skype already available on nearly any smartphone as an app, but Apple and Google already offer their own voice and video calling services in the form of FaceTime and Google Voice, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1220">It may also still be too soon for video chatting, which has yet to become an everyday activity.</seg>
<seg id="1221">&quot;The thing about video chat is that it&apos;s a feature everyone wants but no one uses,&quot; said Dan Costa, an executive editor at PC Magazine.</seg>
<seg id="1222">&quot;Skype has been offering video chat services for a while but find most people use Skype to make voice calls for free.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1223">On the other hand, bringing Skype&apos;s chatting capabilities to Microsoft&apos;s Xbox gaming system could be a huge success: The voice and video features would allow gamers to communicate in ways they cannot on competing products, while also opening up entirely new applications for Microsoft Kinect, a controller-free, camera-equipped gaming sensor that lets users play games just by moving their body.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Microsoft&apos;s Xbox LIVE, an online gaming service that allows players all over the world to connect, communicate and play with each other via the Internet, could get a significant upgrade thanks to Skype bringing its users into closer contact.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Combining Skype&apos;s video chatting with the 10 million Kinect devices Microsoft has sold so far could potentially transform the device and with it, the television screens to which the gaming gadget connects.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Via Kinect, Microsoft could come to command the living room, a battlefield tech heavyweights like Apple and Google have unsuccessfully attempted to conquer.</seg>
<seg id="1227">&quot;There is a real opportunity for Microsoft to integrate Skype with Kinect,&quot; said Costa.</seg>
<seg id="1228">&quot;Eventually, it could maybe even bring teleconferencing into the living room. Microsoft Kinect…could have a great telepresence platform: Instead of using Xbox to play games, mom and dad could be using it to place calls and check in on relatives.&quot;</seg>

<seg id="1229">Prince William &amp; Kate Depart On Honeymoon In Seychelles Islands: Report</seg>
<seg id="1230">So the wait for a royal honeymoon wasn&apos;t so long after all.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Prince William and his wife, the former Kate Middleton, have left for a honeymoon at an undisclosed location, palace officials said Tuesday, declining to elaborate on the key details of where or for how long.</seg>
<seg id="1232">They also requested the young couple&apos;s privacy be respected during that time.</seg>
<seg id="1233">British media widely reported they had jetted off to the Seychelles, an island chain in the Indian Ocean.</seg>
<seg id="1234">William has two weeks leave from his job as a search-and-rescue helicopter pilot, but palace officials would not say if they will be away the entire two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1235">After the media blitz surrounding their April 29 wedding at Westminster Abbey, the couple have made it clear they&apos;d like to be left alone by photographers.</seg>
<seg id="1236">A day after the wedding, the newlyweds asked the media not to intrude on their first weekend of married life, which they spent at home before William returned to military duty.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Privacy has long been a main concern for the royals while planning their honeymoon.</seg>
<seg id="1238">They are thought to have considered private islands in the Caribbean -- although photographers on boats could conceivably get pictures of them cavorting on a beach -- and hideaways in Africa, where William has traveled extensively in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1239">The couple&apos;s decision earlier to delay their honeymoon surprised many.</seg>
<seg id="1240">While he went back to work, Middleton -- now known as the Duchess of Cambridge -- was snapped by photographers grocery shopping near the couple&apos;s home on the remote Welsh island of Angelsey.</seg>
<seg id="1241">The Seychelles is an archipelago of 115 Indian Ocean islands about 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) east of the Kenyan coast.</seg>
<seg id="1242">A popular luxury destination, it lies outside the cyclone belt, so severe storms are rare, adding to the destination&apos;s appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Srdjana Janosevic, the press secretary for the Seychelles&apos; president, had no confirmation Tuesday that the royal couple had arrived or planned to vacation there, but noted they have visited the Seychelles before.</seg>
<seg id="1244">&quot;Anyone who comes back and continues to enjoy the island, it just shows that it&apos;s a very desirable tourist destination,&quot; Janosevic said.</seg>
<seg id="1245"> &quot;I think everyone would be happy if they are here.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1246">The Seychelles has only about 90,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1247">While the British media feature constant stories on the royals, a top headline Tuesday in the Seychelles Nation newspaper was about an increase in pork and chicken production.</seg>
<seg id="1248">The top local topic is the country&apos;s May 19-21 presidential election, where President James Michel faces three challengers.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If the couple have chosen the Seychelles, it will be East Africa&apos;s second connection to the royal wedding.</seg>
<seg id="1250">William proposed to Kate last October in a rustic log cabin on the slopes of Kenya&apos;s highest peak, Mount Kenya.</seg>
<seg id="1251">Both Kenya and the Seychelles are former British colonies.</seg>

<seg id="1253">Explosions rocked eastern Tripoli for almost an hour on Wednesday morning as jets flew overhead, a witness said.</seg>
<seg id="1254">The explosions began about 7:30 am (0530 GMT) and continued sporadically until 8:15 am (0615 GMT), according to the witness.</seg>
<seg id="1255">An international coalition began carrying out strikes on forces loyal to Libyan strongman Moamer Kadhafi on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="1256">NATO took command of operations over Libya on March 31.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The Libyan regime has accused NATO of several attempts on Kadhafi&apos;s life, including an air strike that killed his second youngest son Seif al-Arab Kadhafi and three of his grandchildren.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Italian Brigadier General Claudio Gabellini insisted on Tuesday that &quot;NATO is not targeting individuals.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1259">But asked whether Kadhafi was still alive, the Italian NATO general said: &quot;We don&apos;t have any evidence. We don&apos;t know what Kadhafi is doing right now.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1260">Massive protests in February - inspired by revolts that toppled long-time autocrats in Tunisia and Egypt - escalated into war when Kadhafi&apos;s troops fired on demonstrators and protesters seized several towns.</seg>

<seg id="1261">Two Earthquakes Cause Major Damage in Spain</seg>
<seg id="1262">Two earthquakes struck southeast Spain in quick succession Wednesday, killing at least 10 people, injuring dozens and causing major damage to buildings, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="1263">It was the highest quake-related death toll in Spain in more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The epicenter of the quakes -- with magnitudes of 4.4 and 5.2 -- was close to the town of Lorca, and the second came about two hours after the first, an official with the Murcia regional government said on condition of anonymity in line with department policy.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Dozens of injured people were being treated at the scene and a field hospital was set up in the town of about 85,000 people, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="1266">About 270 patients at a hospital in Lorca were being evacuated by ambulance as a precaution after the building sustained minor damage, the Murcia regional government said.</seg>
<seg id="1267">The Spanish prime minister&apos;s office put the death toll at 10 and the Murcia administration said the deaths included a minor and occurred with the second, stronger quake.</seg>
<seg id="1268">Large chunks of stone and brick fell from the facade of a church in Lorca as a reporter for Spanish state TV was broadcasting live from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1269">A large church bell was also among the rubble, which missed striking the reporter, who appeared to be about 30 feet away when it fell. The broadcaster reported that schoolchildren usually gather at that spot around that time, and if it had happened 10 minutes later, a &quot;tragedy&quot; could have occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Spanish TV showed images of cars that were partially crushed by falling rubble, and large cracks in buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1271">Nervous groups of residents gathered in open public places, talking about what happened and calling relatives and friends on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1272">An elderly woman appeared to be in shock and was seated in a chair as people tried to calm her.</seg>
<seg id="1273">&quot;I felt a tremendously strong movement, followed by a lot of noise, and I was really frightened,&quot; the newspaper El Pais quoted another Lorca resident Juani Avellanada as saying. It did not give her age.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Yet another resident, Juana Ruiz, said her house split open with the quake and &quot;all the furniture fell over,&quot; according to El Pais.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Many residents decided to spend the night camped out in parks and other open spaces, fearing aftershocks and because of structural damage to their homes, according to state TV footage.</seg>
<seg id="1276">This was the deadliest quake in Spain since 1956, when 12 people died and some 70 were injured in a quake in the southern Granada region, according to the National Geographic Institute. It says Spain has about 2,500 quakes a year, but only a handful are actually noticed by people.</seg>
<seg id="1277">Spain&apos;s south and southeast are the most earthquake-prone regions.</seg>
<seg id="1278">The U.S. Geological Survey&apos;s National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colorado, had slightly different magnitudes for the temblors.</seg>
<seg id="1279">John Bellini, a seismologist with the USGS center, said the larger earthquake had a preliminary 5.3 magnitude and struck 220 miles south-southeast of Madrid at 6:47 p.m. (12:47 p.m. ET).</seg>
<seg id="1280">The quake was about 6 miles deep, and was preceded by the smaller one with a 4.5 magnitude in the same spot, Bellini said.</seg>
<seg id="1281">He classified the bigger quake as moderate and said it could cause structural damage to older buildings and masonry.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Lorca has a mix of buildings that are vulnerable to earthquakes and quake-resistant, according to the USGS.</seg>
<seg id="1283">The quakes occurred in a seismically active area near a large fault beneath the Mediterranean Sea where the European and African continents brush past each other, USGS seismologist Julie Dutton said.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The USGS said it has recorded hundreds of small quakes in the area since 1990.</seg>

<seg id="1286">A 52-year-old Nepalese man reached the top of Mount Everest for the 21st time on Wednesday, breaking a record he set last year for the number of ascents of the world&apos;s tallest peak, a tourism official ministry said.</seg>
<seg id="1287">Apa Sherpa first climbed Everest in 1990 while helping international expeditions climb the mountain.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Since 2008, he has been climbing Everest as part of an expedition to highlight the effects of climate change and to collect trash on the mountains.</seg>
<seg id="1289">He started from Camp IV at an altitude of 7,950 meters with five other climbers on Tuesday night and reached on Wednesday morning, according to Asian Trekking, which organized the expedition.</seg>

<seg id="1291">Bin Laden was communicating with other terrorists, U.S. official says</seg>
<seg id="1292">Data and documents taken from the compound show that messages from Osama bin Laden did make it out of the compound to other members of al Qaeda, a U.S. official says.</seg>
<seg id="1293">&quot;There are strong indications there is back and forth with other terrorists,&quot; the official said.</seg>
<seg id="1294">U.S. officials have said they view the raided compound as the al Qaeda leader&apos;s &quot;command and control center&quot; but had not explained before why they believed that to be the case.</seg>
<seg id="1295">&quot;These are not just the writings of an elderly jihadi,&quot; the official said.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The source said there is evidence of two-way written communications demonstrating that not only was bin Laden sending messages, he was getting responses as well.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Bin Laden relatives want probe and proof of death</seg>
<seg id="1298">The official also provided new details on bin Laden&apos;s personal journal, which was seized during the Navy SEAL raid, the official said.</seg>
<seg id="1299">The handwritten journal, which was referred to last week by other officials as the al Qaeda playbook, is being reviewed by intelligence officials.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Other handwritten materials are being reviewed, too.</seg>
<seg id="1301">The initial assessment is that the writings are from bin Laden, not the other occupants of the house.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The official emphasized that the U.S. government is continuing to look at all the material and the initial assessment could change.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The journal includes information about the importance of attacking the U.S. and lists key dates on the American calendar -- including July 4, Christmas and the 10th anniversary of September 11 -- and other guidance for how to attack the United States, the official said. U.S. investigators believe similar information is contained in other documents, the source said.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Official: Bin Laden death offers &apos;new narrative&apos; ahead of Obama speech</seg>
<seg id="1305">Both New York and Washington are mentioned in the document.</seg>
<seg id="1306">The idea of targeting railroads, which authorities warned about last week, was learned from this notebook, the official said.</seg>
<seg id="1307">At this point, the official said, there is no indication of a time, date or place for any specific attack, and much of what has been seen is more bin Laden ideas than actual plans.</seg>

<seg id="1336">The United States and China have claimed success after two days of negotiations ended in a series of deals on U.S. access to the Chinese market and Chinese access to sensitive U.S. technology.</seg>
<seg id="1337">China pledged on Tuesday to change regulations so that government contracts are not linked to improvements in its domestic technology base.</seg>
<seg id="1338">China also promised improvements in the enforcement of intellectual property such as software.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The United States promised &quot;full consideration&quot; of China&apos;s request for &quot;fair treatment&quot; over exports of sensitive U.S. technology and said it welcomes Chinese investment.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The relatively concrete and specific results of the regular &quot;strategic and economic dialogue&quot; between the world&apos;s two largest economies suggest that reduced tension over China&apos;s undervalued currency is making progress easier on trade and investment issues.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Tim Geithner, the U.S. Treasury secretary, hailed &quot;concrete, tangible signs of progress on both sides.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1342">He said China committed to &quot;strengthen the inspection of government software&quot; to make sure that it was paid for and &quot;confirmed that it will no longer employ government procurement preferences for indigenous innovation products at any level of government.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1343">China also pledged to publish proposed regulations 30 days in advance of implementation, answering a U.S. concern that foreign companies are affected by regulations that they cannot always comment on, and the two sides agreed to discuss export credits for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1344">U.S. companies complain that China wins overseas contracts by offering heavily subsidized export finance, as it does not follow an international agreement on export finance terms.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Wang Qishan, Chinese vice-premier, said the U.S. &quot;commits to accord China fair treatment in the reform of its export control regime [and] relax high-tech exports control towards China&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="1346">In financial services, Mr Wang welcomed US willingness to let Chinese banks invest in the U.S., saying it recognized &quot;China&apos;s enormous progress in capital-adequacy ratio, comprehensive consolidation supervision and other regulatory aspects&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The United States also made some progress on opening up China&apos;s financial system.</seg>
<seg id="1348">The United States argues that financial reform will make it easier for Chinese consumers to save and borrow, thus boosting domestic consumption in China.</seg>
<seg id="1349">The U.S. also wants to reduce the flow of cheap finance to Chinese state-owned enterprises as a result of caps on interest rates paid to Chinese depositors and create opportunities for U.S. financial firms in the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="1350">China said that it will &quot;actively study&quot; allowing foreign-owned insurers to provide car insurance, an important demand given that China will become the world&apos;s largest car market.</seg>
<seg id="1351">In the other direction, the U.S. gave reassurances to China about the stability of its huge investment in U.S. financial assets through its foreign exchange reserves.</seg>
<seg id="1352">Mr Wang said that &quot;the United States commits to further enforce strong supervision of government-sponsored enterprises and to make sure they have enough capital to fulfill financial obligations.&quot;</seg>

<seg id="1354">A friend of schoolgirl Amanda &apos;Milly&apos; Dowler was the last person to see her alive before she was snatched off the street and murdered, a court has heard.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Milly, 13, was walking home from school nine years ago when she was snatched &quot;in the blink of an eye&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="1356">Her body was found six months later in woods.</seg>
<seg id="1357">She was killed by violent predator Levi Bellfield, who went on to kill two women and attempt to murder a third, it is alleged.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The Old Bailey was told that Katherine Laynes, a 15-year-old schoolfriend of Milly&apos;s sister Gemma, made eye contact with her moments before she vanished.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Brian Altman QC, prosecuting, said Milly had gone to a cafe at the local railway station in Walton-on-Thames after leaving Heathside School, in Weybridge, Surrey, on March 21, 2002.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Katherine was sitting at a bus stop in Station Avenue when she saw Milly in her school uniform and with her hair in a ponytail.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Mr Altman said: &quot;She was alone at a bus stop.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1362">She thought she was at the stop for about 10 minutes when she saw Milly Dowler walking along on the opposite side of the road.</seg>
<seg id="1363">&quot;According to Katherine, they made eye contact.&quot;Katherine recalled Milly wearing her school uniform - her skirt, shirt and tie.</seg>
<seg id="1364">&quot;When Katherine saw her, Milly was entirely alone.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1365">Katherine boarded a bus moments later and expected to see Milly in Station Avenue continuing her walk, but she was not there, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Three hours later, her parents raised the alarm, prompting one of the biggest missing person&apos;s investigations ever seen in Britain.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Jurors were told CCTV footage showed Bellfield sitting in his car nearby, about 20 minutes after the schoolgirl was last seen - and that examination of the footage indicated Milly must have been abducted &quot;on the defendant&apos;s doorstep&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="1368">Bellfield, 42, formerly of West Drayton, west London, was living just off the street when Milly went missing.</seg>
<seg id="1369">He denies her kidnap and murder.</seg>
<seg id="1370">He also denies the attempted kidnap of 11-year-old Rachel Cowles in Shepperton, Surrey, on March 20, 2002.</seg>
<seg id="1371">In 2008, he was convicted of murdering Marsha McDonnell, 19, in February, 2003, and Amelie Delagrange, 22, in August, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1372">He attempted to murder Kate Sheedy, 18, in May, 2004, by deliberately running her over in a car.</seg>
<seg id="1373">The trial continues.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Queen Rides Out With Youngest Grandchildren</seg>
<seg id="1614">A photograph of the Queen out riding with her two youngest grandchildren amid the bluebells of Windsor Great Park has been released.</seg>
<seg id="1615">The photo was taken in the Easter Monday sunshine to mark the start of the Royal Windsor Horse Show.</seg>
<seg id="1616">Queen Elizabeth is shown on her black pony flanked by Viscount Severn and Lady Louise Windsor, the children of her son Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.</seg>
<seg id="1617">Seven-year-old Lady Louise is ninth in line to the throne and was one of the bridesmaids at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge&apos;s wedding.</seg>
<seg id="1618">Her three-year-old brother James, who is eighth in line to the throne, is pictured with the monarch holding his pony&apos;s leading rein.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Both children were wearing riding hats but the 85-year-old Queen, who on Thursday becomes the second-longest reigning monarch in 1,000 years, was wearing her familiar headscarf.</seg>
<seg id="1620">The British Horse Society told Sky News that whilst the law only compels riders under 14 to wear hats, it strongly recommends that all riders decide to protect their head.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Claire Ellis from the charity said: &quot;A correctly fitting hat which conforms to current safety standards is likely to reduce the incidence or severity of head injuries in the event of an accident.&quot;</seg>

<seg id="1622">Sex, lies and other differences between men and women</seg>
<seg id="1623">We start lying to other people at three years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1624">No longer convinced of our mum&apos;s omnipotent powers, our toddler minds grow in sync with our bodies.</seg>
<seg id="1625">We realise we can think for ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="1626">From that point on, lies are a natural part of the daily tug-of-war between what we&apos;re told to do and what, in all truthfulness, we want to do. Then we grow up.</seg>
<seg id="1627">But as adults, we just lie to ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="1628">From the white lies we tell because we think we&apos;re protecting the feelings of others, when we&apos;re actually just frightened for ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="1629">To the bits of information we choose to &quot;leave out&quot; of a conversation, when really it would be &quot;more honest&quot; and &quot;helpful&quot; to disclose it all.</seg>
<seg id="1630">Ditto flattery, because we&apos;ve all got a motive, sinister or otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Feeling uncomfortable yet?</seg>
<seg id="1632">Australian psychologist and author Dorothy Rowe would probably say that you&apos;re well on your way to becoming a more honest person; these are just a few of the theories that form the content of her new book, &quot;Why we lie&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="1633">Don&apos;t miss her terrific interview at the Perth Writers&apos; festival, that you can watch here.</seg>
<seg id="1634">Rowe says most people just need to realise that we &quot;don&apos;t need to lie&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="1635">The more time we spend &quot;peeling back the layers&quot; and asking ourselves how we can best &quot;tell the truth&quot; in each, unique situation, the more honest we will be.</seg>
<seg id="1636">Kindness, tone, clarity and timing are all important considerations because ultimately, &quot;the truth has to become something you can exist with.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1637">Admitting to what you&apos;re willing to lie about is also revealing.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In a recent piece for Psychology Today, Satoshi Kanazawa claimed there&apos;s a clear distinction between the types of things women and men lie about.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Women &quot;lie down&quot; – preferring people to think of them as younger and &quot;lighter&quot; than what they really are and men, &quot;lie-up&quot; boosting their earnings and their height to appear more successful than what in reality they really are.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Sexual conquest is another common lie between the sexes.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Australian psychologist Nick Petrovic says thanks to societal notions of &quot;sexual prowess&quot; men choose to increase their number of sexual partners and women more likely to decrease them.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Men are also ten per cent less likely to disclose their infidelity than women, while women are more likely to tell lies about other people rather than themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1643">Rowe says the more we lie, the further apart we grow from reality.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Our relationships never progress because we can&apos;t get beyond the surface of things.</seg>
<seg id="1645">In other words, when we lie, we just lose ourselves.</seg>

<seg id="1646">Awesome! Now you can play Angry Birds on the web</seg>
<seg id="1647">IT&apos;S already the most popular mobile phone game to play on the way to work. Now you can keep going at the office.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The makers of Angry Birds have announced the first version of the game for computer web browsers, after racking up more than 140 million downloads on mobile devices.</seg>
<seg id="1649">There is a catch, though -- the game is only available to play on Google&apos;s Chrome web browser.</seg>
<seg id="1650">Update: News.com.au readers say the game also works on Internet Explorer 9 and Mozilla Firefox 4. Hooray!</seg>
<seg id="1651">&quot;We&apos;ve wanted to bring Angry Birds to the web for a long time,&quot; said Peter Vesterbacka of Finnish software company Rovio, at a Google developers conference in San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1652">&quot;One of the reasons we&apos;ve been angry is we haven&apos;t been able to bring this to the web until today.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1653">Mr Vesterbacka stepped on stage during a conference keynote at which Google engineers showed off Chrome browser improvements that included ramped-up graphics speeds for smooth rendering of imagery in games.</seg>
<seg id="1654">&quot;We are bringing Angry Birds to the biggest platform of the web, and it&apos;s one of the best versions we&apos;ve built to date,&quot; he said.</seg>
<seg id="1655">&quot;It really rocks, as you will see.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1656">Angry Birds can be played online at chrome.angrybirds.com, or you can install it as a Chrome application to play when not connected to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1657">&quot;It will make those flights more bearable,&quot; said Mr Vesterbacka, who is referred to as Rovio&apos;s &quot;Mighty Eagle&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="1658">Angry Birds has shot to pop culture stardom and launched Rovio into worldwide fame.</seg>
<seg id="1659">In April a Rovio executive said the game had been downloaded 140 million times.</seg>
<seg id="1660">The game involves catapulting cartoonish birds into absurd fortresses built by little green pigs who have stolen the birds&apos; eggs.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Can emotions ail my body?</seg>
<seg id="1662">Mim Beim outlines the effect stress, anxiety and depression have on your physical health.</seg>
<seg id="1663">(Q) I had eczema all over my body for ages. As soon as I quit the job I hated, the eczema went. How could this happen?</seg>
<seg id="1664">(A) Medical tests can now track the effect stress, anxiety and depression have on the immune, nervous and hormonal systems.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Louise L. Hay&apos;s 1970s book, Heal Your Body, was a trail blazer in creating an awareness that what goes on between the ears may have an impact elsewhere in the body.</seg>
<seg id="1666">Her personal story included being sexually abused as a child.</seg>
<seg id="1667">Using her own experience to reach out to others, soon after being diagnosed with vaginal cancer Hay set about finding out what may have been a trigger to this disease and, more importantly, what she could do to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1668">Hay believed her childhood trauma explained the &quot;where&quot; of her cancer and also the &quot;why&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="1669">She also believed people have the ability to improve their physical health by changing negative attitudes and belief patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1670">Change isn&apos;t easy, particularly if patterns are set down in childhood.</seg>
<seg id="1671">&quot;Affirmations&quot; were the technique Hay chose to break down these patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Not dissimilar to cognitive behaviour therapy popular in modern psychology, affirmations are positive statements that help one rewrite negative mental scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1673">Hay was also interested in where the illness manifests in the body.</seg>
<seg id="1674">Other modalities have also noticed a link with emotions and illness.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Traditional Chinese Medicine claims that angry emotions will affect the liver, fear the kidneys, grief the lungs and unhappiness the heart.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Hay is even more specific. For instance, cystitis – an infection of the bladder – may be a sign you&apos;re &quot;pissed off&quot; at your partner.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Eczema may reflect irritation to your surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Shoulder pain may be a sign one feels burdened or emotionally unsupported.</seg>
<seg id="1679">While this may sound a bit trite, I&apos;ve often found there is a link. At the very least, if you&apos;re ill, it&apos;s worth considering whether emotions and attitudes may be part of the story.</seg>

<seg id="1680">Five steps to going vegan</seg>
<seg id="1681">Brian Johnston&apos;s tips to prepare you for this major lifestyle change.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Turning vegan means eliminating animal products from your diet: not only meat and fish, but dairy products and even foods such as honey.</seg>
<seg id="1683">That&apos;s no easy task – many supermarket foods contain trace elements of animal products – but a willingness to change and positive attitude make it easier at first.</seg>
<seg id="1684">In the long term, the benefits you reap will keep you going.</seg>
<seg id="1685">People become vegans for a variety of reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Some object to the inhumane nature and major environmental impact of animal-based agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Other vegans point to the considerable health benefits of a low-fat, zero-cholesterol, high-fibre diet.</seg>
<seg id="1688">&quot;There&apos;s mounting scientific evidence that a wholefood vegan diet can prevent heart disease, type-2 diabetes, many cancers, obesity and arthritis,&quot; says Meghan Street from Vegan Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="1689">However, vegan diets can be unsuitable for children, pregnant women and the elderly, and a poorly considered vegan diet can leave you deficient in iron, calcium, omega-3 and certain vitamins.</seg>
<seg id="1690">&quot;Vegans may need to get their vitamin B12 from fortified products or a supplement,&quot; cautions Dr Maxine Bonham at Monash University&apos;s Department of Nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1691">Ensuring adequate intakes of vitamin D, calcium and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids is also important.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Being well informed about food is the key for vegans, who can expect to become more familiar with soy or almond milk, legumes (peas, lentils and beans), whole grains and nuts.</seg>
<seg id="1693">&quot;There are also many high-quality, dairy-free cheeses and imitation meats on the market,&quot; says Jeremy Johnson of Vegan Perfection. &quot;Many of them are organic and, as well as tasting good, are far healthier than their animal-based competitors.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1694">While being vegan in a non-vegan world isn&apos;t always easy, vegans say they have more energy and feel better.</seg>
<seg id="1695">&quot;Just by simply changing the food on our plate we can be kinder to ourselves, to our environment and to our fellow animals,&quot; says Meghan Street.</seg>
<seg id="1696">&quot;It&apos;s a peaceful, low impact and healthier existence, which can only be a good thing.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1697">Five steps to becoming a vegan:</seg>
<seg id="1698">Get ready</seg>
<seg id="1699">Veganism is a significant lifestyle change that requires ongoing determination and commitment.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Make sure</seg>
<seg id="1701">you&apos;re very clear why you want to become vegan before making the transition.</seg>
<seg id="1702">Get set</seg>
<seg id="1703">Good preparation is vital.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Do your research.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Talk to vegans about the ins and outs, get onto vegan blogs, acquaint yourself with vegan products, and study the health implications.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Go slow</seg>
<seg id="1707">Become vegan in stages, giving the body time to adjust and making lifestyle changes easier.</seg>
<seg id="1708">Gradually eliminate meat, dairy products, then all animal products over many weeks, while adopting alternatives.</seg>
<seg id="1709">Start cooking</seg>
<seg id="1710">Veganism is time consuming: most packaged and restaurant foods are out of bounds.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Collect recipes from books and online.</seg>
<seg id="1712">Vegan food can be delicious and inventive, but it needs preparation.</seg>
<seg id="1713">See your doctor</seg>
<seg id="1714">Have a health check before and after turning vegan, and seek advice on a balanced diet.</seg>
<seg id="1715">&quot;Take a food diary with you to the consultation,&quot; suggests Dr Nancy Sturman at the University of Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="1716">&quot;A blood test to confirm adequate levels of vitamins and trace elements may also be wise.&quot;</seg>

<seg id="1717">Beating asthma naturally</seg>
<seg id="1718">Naturopath Mim Beim shares some natural methods for reducing the symptoms of asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1719">(Q) I&apos;ve had asthma all my life and now my seven-year-old son has been diagnosed with it.</seg>
<seg id="1720">Are there any natural remedies?</seg>
<seg id="1721">(A) In Australia, one in four children and one in 10 adults suffer from asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1722">If left unmanaged, the results can be alarming, even fatal.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Treatment is to take one or a combination of drugs including steroids and bronchodilators.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Natural remedies can be very effective in reducing the symptoms of asthma and are safe to be used in conjunction with drug therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1725">While the cause of asthma is uncertain, there is a big genetic factor.</seg>
<seg id="1726">Triggers may include exercise, cold air, pollution, cigarette smoke, stress, coughing and preservatives, especially the sulphites common in wine, dried fruit and bottled juices.</seg>
<seg id="1727">The goals in any asthma treatment, whether naturopathic or conventional, are to reduce inflammation and spasming of the bronchi (air passageways in the lungs).</seg>
<seg id="1728">Additionally, as a result of all this commotion in the airways, excess mucus is produced, making this the third target of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One of the most effective natural anti-inflammatories are the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, linseeds and walnuts.</seg>
<seg id="1730">Increasing these foods in the diet will help, but for a more powerful effect take omega-3 fatty acids as a supplement.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Other anti-inflammatory foods include ginger, onion and garlic.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The latter two also help break down mucus: an extra bonus.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Magnesium is a good muscle relaxant, making it the perfect mineral for asthma control.</seg>
<seg id="1734">The Buteyko breathing technique has shown some spectacular results in the treatment of asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1735">This technique has been studied extensively and reported favourably in journals including the Australian Medical Journal, where participants had a reduction of asthma symptoms and steroid medication.</seg>
<seg id="1736">What is interesting is that this method reflects certain ancient yoga breathing techniques that concur we must only breathe through the nose, not the mouth, and to breathe softly and slowly.</seg>

<seg id="1756">UN agencies hail trial results showing anti-HIV drugs prevent sexual transmission</seg>
<seg id="1757">12 May 2011 – United Nations agencies fighting HIV/AIDS today lauded the results of an international study that shows that if an HIV-positive person immediately follows an appropriate treatment of anti-retroviral drugs, the risk of transmitting the virus to an uninfected sexual partner is nearly entirely eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1758">The trial, conducted by the HIV Prevention Trials Network, tracked more than 1,700 couples across Africa, Asia, Latin America and the United States and found that the risk of infection fell by 96 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The reduction in risk was so large that the trial was stopped some three to four years ahead of schedule.</seg>
<seg id="1760">&quot;This breakthrough is a serious game changer,&quot; said Michel Sidibé, the Executive Director of the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), who added that &quot;now we need to make sure that couples have the option to choose treatment for prevention and have access to it.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1761">Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), described the results of the study as &quot;a crucial development, because we know that sexual transmission accounts for about 80 per cent of all new infections.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1762">UNAIDS said it will convene a meeting with other key organizations tackling the scourge of AIDS to discuss the trial and its implications for the response to the disease.</seg>
<seg id="1763">In July, WHO is also releasing new guidance to assist HIV-positive people to protect their partners.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The two agencies stressed the need for couples to make evidence-based decisions on which combination of HIV prevention options is best for them, and that anti-retroviral therapy serve as one of the options made available.</seg>
<seg id="1765">&quot;No single method is fully protective against HIV,&quot; the agencies said in a joint press statement.</seg>
<seg id="1766">&quot;Treatment for prevention [anti-retroviral therapy] needs to be used in combination with other HIV prevention options. These include correct and consistent use of male and female condoms, waiting longer before having sex for the first time, having fewer partners, male circumcision, and avoiding penetrative sex.&quot;</seg>

<seg id="1767">Global tourism continues to rebuild, UN data reveals</seg>
<seg id="1768">12 May 2011 – International tourism continues to recover from the global financial crisis and downturn of 2008-09, rising in every region of the world except the Middle East and North Africa during the first two months of this year, according to new United Nations figures.</seg>
<seg id="1769">The latest update of UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) barometer, released yesterday, show that international tourist arrivals grew by almost 5 per cent to more than 124 million in January and February this year compared to the same period in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1770">South America and South Asia were the best performers, with international visitor numbers leaping by 15 per cent in both regions, while sub-Saharan Africa (13 per cent) and Central and Eastern Europe (12 per cent) also posted strong gains.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Europe overall performed better than expected, partly because of travel redirected to Southern and Mediterranean Europe following the unrest in many nations in North Africa and the Middle East, where visitor numbers slumped by 9 per cent and 10 per cent respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Taleb Rifai, the Secretary-General of the UNWTO, said the latest data indicates that the tourism sector is consolidating the recovery begun last year.</seg>
<seg id="1773">&quot;News is especially positive for emerging economies and developing countries, particularly for Africa, where tourism is increasingly recognized as a driver of development, exports and jobs,&quot; he said.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Mr. Rifai said the fall in visitor demand in Tunisia and Egypt after the recent unrest there, and a similar slump in Japan following the March earthquake and tsunami, is now &quot;expected to have bottomed out and the recovery of these important destinations will surely be consolidated during the year.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1775">The Secretary-General took part earlier this week in a special event in Istanbul, Turkey, linking tourism with sustainable development and poverty reduction. This was held on the sidelines of the UN conference on the world&apos;s least developed countries (LDCs).</seg>
<seg id="1776">He said it was surprising that the development agenda has given such a low priority so far to tourism, despite the industry&apos;s &quot;proven contribution to foreign exchange generation, job creation and socio-economic development.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="1777">The gathering brought together 15 tourism ministers from LDCs as well as senior UN officials and representatives of donor countries to discuss ways to integrate tourism into development plans.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Receipts from international tourism are estimated to have topped $919 billion last year, up from $851 billion a year earlier.</seg>

<seg id="1779">UN chief welcomes 100th ratification of UN disability convention as ‘milestone&apos;</seg>
<seg id="1780">12 May 2011 – Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon today hailed Colombia&apos;s signing of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as an &quot;important milestone,&quot; emphasizing the treaty&apos;s role in providing inclusion and development for persons with disabilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1781">On 10 May, the South American nation became the 100th country to ratify the Convention which supports greater access for the disabled to participate in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="1782">It is widely regarded as the first international human rights treaty of the twenty-first century.</seg>
<seg id="1783">&quot;This is an important milestone for Colombia and for the global community,&quot; Mr. Ban said, commenting on the signing.</seg>
<seg id="1784">&quot;The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is a powerful tool for inclusion and development. Let us use it to make concrete improvements in the lives of persons with disabilities,&quot; he added.</seg>
<seg id="1785">About 10 per cent of the global population, or 650 million people, live with a disability, with many excluded from fully participating in the economic, social, and political lives of their communities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">An estimated 386 million people of working age suffer from some form of disability, with unemployment rates in this category soaring as high as 80 per cent in some countries.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Mr. Ban&apos;s remarks were echoed by Sha Zukang, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), who said he was greatly encouraged by the ratification.</seg>
<seg id="1788">DESA is the UN department which serves as Secretariat for the Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1789">&quot;This is a great achievement by the international community in working towards a just and equitable society, based on equality and equal opportunity for all, including persons with disabilities,&quot; Mr. Sha said.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The Convention was adopted by the General Assembly in 2006 in an effort to ensure that persons with disabilities enjoy the same human rights as everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="1791">Eighty-two countries immediately ratified it – the highest number for a UN treaty in history.</seg>

<seg id="1793">WASHINGTON - TRAVEL industry leaders in the United States called on Thursday for an end to the &apos;burdensome&apos; visitor visa program, saying it drives tourists and their job-creating dollars to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1794">&apos;The United States imposes unnecessary barriers on international visitors that inhibit economic growth,&apos; the US Travel Association said in a report outlining ways to increase travel to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1795">&apos;Specifically, a burdensome US visa system drives millions of potential travellers to other countries at an enormous cost to our economy,&apos; said the report, entitled &apos;Ready for Takeoff&apos;.</seg>
<seg id="1796">The study considered every dollar spent by foreign visitors to the United States to be an export dollar, which makes travel &apos;an easy export industry to expand and a key to closing our trade deficit&apos;.</seg>
<seg id="1797">Increasing the number of visitors to the United States could help to double exports within five years and create 1.3 million new jobs by 2020, the report said.</seg>
<seg id="1798">A key step to achieving that, the study advised, is to do away with what the group called an onerous visa system.</seg>
<seg id="1799">It can take six months or longer for Brazilians and Chinese to get visas to come to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1800">The US visa system has also prevented foreign businessmen from attending revenue-generating trade shows and exhibits in the United States, and some large trade shows and conferences are choosing overseas venues instead of US ones, to ensure that all members of a country&apos;s delegation can attend.</seg>

<seg id="1801">Finger length clue to motor neurone disease</seg>
<seg id="1802">The length of a person&apos;s fingers could reveal their risk of motor neurone disease, according to a study.</seg>
<seg id="1803">UK researchers measured the finger length of 110 people, including 47 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common form of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="1804">The study, in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, suggests a link between a longer fourth finger relative to the index finger and ALS.</seg>
<seg id="1805">Experts say finger length cannot help screen for ALS and more work is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The ratio between the fingers has already been linked to many traits, including sporting prowess and aggression, and is believed to be set in the womb.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Experts believe a longer fourth finger relative to the index finger could be partly determined by how much exposure a baby has to the male hormone testosterone before birth.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Indeed, men often do have slightly longer ring fingers than index fingers, while women often do not.</seg>
<seg id="1809">And experts know that motor neurons need testosterone for survival and repair, and men who are born without the ability to use testosterone in the normal way develop a form of motor neuron degeneration.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Dr Brian Dickie of the Motor Neurone Disease Association, said: &quot;This simple, but carefully conducted study raises some interesting questions about how events occurring before birth may increase the risk of developing motor neuron disease later in life.</seg>
<seg id="1811">&quot;But it&apos;s important to remember that exposure to higher testosterone in the womb does not directly cause motor neuron disease.</seg>
<seg id="1812">&quot;Many people with long ring fingers will never develop motor neuron disease as we believe there are numerous genetic and environmental factors that need to coincide in order to trigger the disease.&quot;</seg>

<seg id="2175">15 May 2011 – Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has led a chorus of United Nations calls for all sides in the Middle East to exercise maximum restraint after a day of clashes around the region in which at least a dozen people are reported to have died.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Clashes took place today along the Blue Line between Israel and Lebanon, in the occupied Golan after the breach of the disengagement line from the Syrian side, and in the occupied Palestinian territory.</seg>
<seg id="2177">The clashes followed demonstrations by Palestinians to mark the anniversary of Israeli independence in 1948.</seg>
<seg id="2178">&quot;The Secretary-General is deeply concerned that a significant number of people have been killed or injured,&quot; his spokesperson said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="2179">&quot;He calls on all concerned to show restraint and refrain from provocations so as to prevent escalation of tensions and ensure civilians are not killed or injured.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="2180">In the statement Mr. Ban said he was &quot;acutely conscious of the unsustainable status quo in the Arab-Israeli conflict, which is only thrown into sharper relief by the profound political changes now under way in the region.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="2181">The Secretary-General stressed &quot;the urgent need for a just, lasting and comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, which ensures dignity and security for all, including an end to occupation, an end to conflict, and a just and agreed solution to the plight of Palestinian refugees.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="2182">He reiterated calls to resume Israeli-Palestinian negotiations towards a resolution that would allow two States to live side by side in peace and security, and &quot;advance the broader goal of a comprehensive regional peace in the Middle East.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="2183">Mr. Ban&apos;s call for restraint was echoed by Major-General Alberto Asarta Cuevas, the Force Commander of the UN peacekeeping operation in southern Lebanon (UNIFIL), following the clashes near the village of Maroun al Ras.</seg>
<seg id="2184">Maj.-Gen. Cuevas said he was in personal contact with the command of the Lebanese and Israeli parties as part of UNIFIL&apos;s efforts to prevent further casualties.</seg>
<seg id="2185">&quot;Immediate concrete security steps on the ground are necessary,&quot; he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos, currently visiting the occupied Palestinian territory, voiced extreme concern about today&apos;s clashes.</seg>
<seg id="2187">&quot;The situation cannot continue in this way. It is innocent people who are losing their lives,&quot; she said.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Ms. Amos met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad as she visited Ramallah, East Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2189">The Under-Secretary-General visited a school in Area C that is scheduled for demolition because the Al Jahalin Bedouin community has not been able to obtain a building permit from Israeli authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2190">&quot;Palestinians are utterly frustrated by the impact of Israeli policies on their lives. They can&apos;t move freely around their territory.</seg>
<seg id="2191">They can&apos;t plan their communities.</seg>
<seg id="2192">They are evicted from their homes.</seg>
<seg id="2193">Their homes are regularly demolished,&quot; she said.</seg>
<seg id="2194">&quot;I don&apos;t believe that most people in Israel have any idea of the way planning policies are used to divide and harass communities and families.</seg>
<seg id="2195">They would not themselves like to be subjected to such behaviour.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="2196">Ms. Amos is slated to visit the Gaza Strip tomorrow, the third day of her four-day visit to the region.</seg>

<seg id="2197">Before It Can Rebuild, Japanese Town Must Survive</seg>
<seg id="2198">The crumpled cars have reddened with rust, and spring rains and a warming sun have left the ashes and mud hardened into an earthen plate of armor.</seg>
<seg id="2199">But Satoshi Watanabe still comes every day to pick through the charred debris that was once his home, searching for the remains of his 2-month-old infant daughter.</seg>
<seg id="2200">She was swept away by the tsunami that flattened much of this fishing town and killed his wife, mother and two other young daughters.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Once he finds the missing child, Mr. Watanabe said, he will leave this town and its painful memories for good.</seg>
<seg id="2202">&quot;No one wants to build here again,&quot; said Mr. Watanabe, 42, who spoke in short sentences punctuated by long sighs.</seg>
<seg id="2203">&quot;This place is just too scary.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="2204">Two months after a huge earthquake and tsunami, devastated coastal communities like this one remain far from recovery and, with many working-age people moving away, they face the prospect that they could simply wither away and, ultimately, perhaps even disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2205">With neither homes nor jobs to lose, and fearing another tsunami from the continuing aftershocks, many residents have already left.</seg>
<seg id="2206">Town officials now fear losing the bulk of working-age families, leaving this already graying town with an overwhelmingly elderly population that might lack the energy or the incentive to undertake a lengthy reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="2207">And that poses another hurdle.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Experts have said that it will be years before the rebuilding is complete and the number of jobs returns to anything like its former level -- another reason, many experts and townspeople worry, for working-age residents to flee.</seg>
<seg id="2209">&quot;Otsuchi must move quickly in order to survive,&quot; said Seiichi Mori, an economist at Gifu Keizai University who is helping draw up recovery plans.</seg>
<seg id="2210">As a stopgap measure, Otsuchi announced in late April that it planned to hire 270 townspeople to remove debris.</seg>
<seg id="2211">But with a lengthy reconstruction ahead, many experts and townspeople fear an exodus of younger residents, who cannot wait years for a job.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Town officials say they are trying to draw up plans that will entice younger residents to stay.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Most of the ideas are coming from Tokyo and call for grand schemes to move coastal towns to higher ground by constructing huge platforms or shearing off nearby mountaintops -- the sorts of megaprojects that Japan may no longer be able to afford.</seg>
<seg id="2214">But town officials say they are overwhelmed by more immediate demands, like relocating the 2,247 residents who still sleep on the floors of school gymnasiums and other cramped refugee centers to longer-term temporary housing, or finding the 1,044 who remain missing in this town, which had 15,239 residents before the tsunami. So far, the bodies of 680 people have been found.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Just cleaning up the mounds of debris left by the waves, which towered as high as 50 feet and destroyed more than half of Otsuchi&apos;s homes and buildings, will very likely take a year.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The town&apos;s administrative functions were also crippled by the waves, which gutted the town hall and killed the mayor and some 30 town employees.</seg>
<seg id="2217">&quot;We are far from reconstruction,&quot; said Masaaki Tobai, 66, the vice mayor, who stepped in to lead the town and who survived by scrambling to the town hall&apos;s roof.</seg>
<seg id="2218">&quot;Medical services, administration, education, police, fire, retail stores, hotels, fishing cooperative, farming cooperative, industry, jobs -- all are gone, all washed away.&quot;</seg>

<seg id="2219">An Eye for an Eye: Iran&apos;s Blinding Justice System</seg>
<seg id="2220">Iran&apos;s judiciary has postponed the blinding of a man as punishment for throwing acid in the face of a young woman in 2004, after she rejected his offer of marriage.</seg>
<seg id="2221">The delay came in the face of mounting outcry both inside Iran and in the West over the sentencing, which is permissible under qesas, a principle of Islamic law allowing victims analogous retribution for violent crimes.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The case has stirred passionate interest in Iran since 2004, when Majid Movahedi, a university student, accosted Ameneh Bahrami on a Tehran street and tossed a red bucket of sulfuric acid in her face.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Bahrami, an attractive young engineer, had repeatedly spurned Movahedi&apos;s proposals and reported his harassment to the police.</seg>
<seg id="2224">She was blinded and severely disfigured in the attack, and has spent the intervening years between Iran and Spain undergoing numerous unsuccessful operations to reconstruct her face and repair her sight.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Much of the public outcry in Iranian media, news websites, and blogs, surrounds the Iranian legal system, which produces such verdicts by practising an &apos;eye for an eye&apos; approach to justice based on seventh century Islamic jurisprudence.</seg>
<seg id="2226">These principles effectively offer victims of violent crime two legal choices, forgiveness or qesas, analogous retribution.</seg>
<seg id="2227">&quot;Bahrami must sit in the place of the judge and either forgive her attacker or take revenge&quot; says Asieh Amini, an Iranian women&apos;s rights activist living in Europe?</seg>
<seg id="2228">&quot;The legal system pushes her into a dead-end, and it&apos;s really the law that&apos;s deficient here.&quot; Bahrami eventually chose qesas, determined that her experience would serve as deterrence for future crimes.</seg>
<seg id="2229">&quot;I want people like him to know that they will suffer forever if they cause someone such suffering,&quot; she said on BBC Persian television Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Speaking on the interactive television program Saturday, Bahrami said she favored a more modern course, suing for damages.</seg>
<seg id="2231">&quot;I want him to be punished foremost.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But if there are human rights considerations, then I&apos;ll accept two million Euros and his life imprisonment,&quot; she said.</seg>
<seg id="2233">The program featured an emotional exchange between Bahrami and Movahedi&apos;s weeping mother, who begged for her forgiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2234">It drew a flood of callers from inside Iran, many of them concerned that Bahrami&apos;s &quot;forgiveness,&quot; while perhaps the most humanitarian course, would encourage such a horrific crime by implying legal leniency.</seg>
<seg id="2235">&quot;Ameneh, daughter of Iran, we understand your joy and we support you,&quot; wrote a prominent Iranian blogger, Dalghak Irani, featured on the program.</seg>

<seg id="2237">James Bulger&apos;s story reads like the plot of a thousand mobster films.</seg>
<seg id="2238">An Irish-American boy grows up in the poor neighborhood of South Boston -- Southie -- turns to a life of crime and ends up leader of the Irish Mob. Smart, charismatic and generous to those he liked, Bulger -- whose blond hair earned him the nickname Whitey -- was both feared and revered.</seg>
<seg id="2239">At the height of his power in the 1980s, he was allegedly taking a share of almost every drug deal and racketeering operation in Boston.</seg>
<seg id="2240">But since 1995, Bulger, now 81, has been on the run.</seg>
<seg id="2241">He fled the city, and probably the U.S., after receiving a tip from the FBI agent he had worked with as an informant that an indictment for federal racketeering was on its way.</seg>
<seg id="2242">In the years that Bulger -- who is also accused of 19 counts of murder, extortion and drug dealing -- has been a fugitive, several of his Mob associates have been arrested and, in some cases, served time.</seg>
<seg id="2243">The FBI handler who helped him escape, John Connolly, is currently in prison for his role in the 1982 killing of a businessman who was about to testify against members of Bulger&apos;s gang.</seg>

<seg id="2322">Look Up! A Rare Planetary Alignment, Visible from Earth</seg>
<seg id="2323">Good thing President Obama released his long-form birth certificate. Now we can all go back to worrying about an even greater threat than the possibility that the President is a Kenyan double agent: the much buzzed-about reports that the world is going to end in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="2324">It was the Mayans -- or maybe the Romans or the Greeks or the Sumerians -- who called the shot this time, evidently on a day Nostradamus phoned in sick.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Apparently, a rogue planet named Nibiru (which frankly sounds more like a new Honda than a new world) is headed our way, with a cosmic crack-up set for next year.</seg>
<seg id="2326">No matter who&apos;s behind the current prediction, there are enough people ready to spread and believe in this kind of end-of-the-world hooey that you have to wonder if the earth isn&apos;t starting to take things personally.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Regrettably, the Nibiru yarn got a boost in recent days with the very real announcement that an alignment of several of the very real planets will be taking place this month, offering a fleeting treat for stargazers willing to get up before sunrise and take a look.</seg>
<seg id="2328">Even this genuine cosmic phenomenon, however, may be a bit less than it appears.</seg>
<seg id="2329">Beginning today and lasting for a few weeks, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter and Mars will be visible in the early morning sky, aligned roughly along the ecliptic -- or the path the sun travels throughout the day.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Uranus and Neptune, much fainter but there all the same, should be visible through binoculars.</seg>
<seg id="2331">What gives the end-of-the-worlders shivers is that just such a configuration is supposed to occur on Dec. 21, 2012, and contribute in some unspecified way to the demolition of the planet.</seg>
<seg id="2332">But what makes that especially nonsensical -- apart from the fact that it&apos;s, you know, nonsense -- is that astronomers say no remotely similar alignment will occur next year.</seg>
<seg id="2333">&quot;Nothing bad will happen to the earth in 2012,&quot; NASA explains patiently -- if wearily -- on its website.</seg>
<seg id="2334">&quot;Our planet has been getting along just fine for more than 4 billion years, and credible scientists worldwide know of no threat associated with 2012.&quot;</seg>

<seg id="2336">Divorce is often nasty but once in a while, the details of a particular breakup grab ahold of the soul and won&apos;t let go.</seg>
<seg id="2337">One such case involves Alaina Giordano, a mother of two who is battling Stage 4 breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2338">On April 25 Giordano lost custody of her children, when a judge ruled that they would need to relocate from their Durham, N.C., to live with their father in Chicago by June 17 because, essentially, the judge said, a healthy dad is better than a sick mom.</seg>
<seg id="2339">Giordano was stunned.</seg>
<seg id="2340">She had expected an open-and-shut case.</seg>
<seg id="2341">Quickly, an elementary-school friend leaped into action, slapping up a Facebook page that he hoped would spread the word and help Giordano attract a pro bono lawyer who could challenge Judge Nancy Gordon&apos;s ruling.</seg>
<seg id="2342">She&apos;s seeking an altruistic attorney because Giordano doesn&apos;t earn an income -- she&apos;s a stay-at-home mom (SAHM, natch), the toughest of jobs -- a fact that was used against her in the custody battle, igniting a wave of support from fellow SAHMers.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Concern over Giordano&apos;s health was also a primary issue in the custody battle.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Her cancer was diagnosed in 2007, about six months before she moved with her family to Durham so that her husband, Kane Snyder, could study for his M.B.A. at Duke University.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The cancer has since metastasized to her bones, which is hardly a good thing.</seg>
<seg id="2346">But her treatment regimen is keeping the disease at bay; she says it is not actively spreading.</seg>
<seg id="2347">And it&apos;s anyone&apos;s guess how long she&apos;ll live.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the meantime, she says she&apos;s able to parent and, if her recent media schedule is any gauge, rival the stamina of a triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="2349">On Wednesday, Giordano was in New York City for a publicity blitz.</seg>
<seg id="2350">She awoke at 5 a.m. to arrive at the Today show set with her kids, 11-year-old Sofia and 5-year-old Bud.</seg>
<seg id="2351">She did her interview; her kids met Matt Lauer.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Afterward, she knocked out another few interviews, including The Gayle King Show and CNN, where they ran into Michelle Obama&apos;s brother and Anderson Cooper.</seg>
<seg id="2353">Then there was lunch with Giordano&apos;s cousin and dinner with the kids at the Hard Rock Cafe (the haunted Jekyll and Hyde Club having proved too spooky for Bud).</seg>
<seg id="2354">They gallivanted through Central Park and finished the day in the audience of &quot;The Addams Family,&quot; a Broadway musical.</seg>
<seg id="2355">&quot;I&apos;m totally functional,&quot; says Giordano.</seg>
<seg id="2356">As she waited with her kids for her return flight to North Carolina, Giordano spoke with Healthland about fighting -- for her life, but mostly for her children.</seg>

<seg id="2429">In Defense of Motherhood: Why We Keep Having Kids When They&apos;re So Clearly Bad for Us</seg>
<seg id="2430">Here at Healthland, we devote a considerable amount of virtual ink to reporting on research that disses parenthood.</seg>
<seg id="2431">I&apos;ve written several stories in this vein, and I find them both wryly amusing and often uncomfortably accurate.</seg>
<seg id="2432">But at least in my experience parenting three young kids, they&apos;re not the whole truth.</seg>
<seg id="2433">So in honor of Mother&apos;s Day, I decided to analyze why it&apos;s so fab to be a mom and dig up some data in defense of motherhood -- and parenting in general.</seg>
<seg id="2434">Because despite the inexorable toll children take on our finances, our patience, our emotions and our energy reserves, they really are pretty great.</seg>
<seg id="2435">Let&apos;s get this out in the open: there is not an impressive cache of objective research extolling the benefits of parenthood.</seg>
<seg id="2436">Yet the subjective evidence is overwhelming: the sprinkling of freckles on my 8-year-old&apos;s nose, the offset dimple and Coppertone tan lines on my chopstick-thin 6-year-old&apos;s body, the platinum frizz of curls that waves in the breeze as my almost 4-year-old demonstrates her newfound ability to keep a swing in motion.</seg>
<seg id="2437">In recent months, posts have described how women with children exercise less and eat worse than women without kids and how parents tend to overemphasize the rewards of having children, to the point of delusion.</seg>
<seg id="2438">Parents also suffer depression more than non-parents.</seg>
<seg id="2439">In truth, anyone who&apos;s got a child living at home doesn&apos;t really need someone with a Ph.D. to drive home the point that parents have less free time and less sex, with more exhaustion, frustration and time spent idling in the carpool lane, than the kid-free segment of our society.</seg>
<seg id="2440">So why do we do it?</seg>
<seg id="2441"> Maybe because despite all the rigors and annoyances, the love between parent and child is unprecedented in its passion.</seg>
<seg id="2442"> It&apos;s blinding and fierce and feels completely different than romance.</seg>
<seg id="2443"> I don&apos;t know if scientists have looked into whether parents smile and laugh more than non-parents, but I&apos;ll bet they do.</seg>
<seg id="2444"> Kids are funny.</seg>
<seg id="2445"> They are you before you became hardened and wizened, before you experienced sorrow, before you went all cynical on the world.</seg>
<seg id="2446">Having children introduces you to things you never previously cared about: soccer and swim team and peace signs as a fashion statement, pandas and airline insignias and rock-collecting.</seg>
<seg id="2447">It re-introduces you to long-lost pleasures: making S&apos;mores and snow cremes.</seg>

<seg id="2455">Despite recent alerts, nuclear regulators give an &apos;all-safe&apos;</seg>
<seg id="2456">At a hearing Thursday, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said things are fine.</seg>
<seg id="2457">But it also acknowledged it is double-checking key items to verify preparedness in the wake of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="2458">In its first interim report on US nuclear reactor safety since the Fukushima disaster, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reported Thursday that no major safety problems were found – but acknowledged it is double-checking key items to verify preparedness.</seg>
<seg id="2459">&quot;As we stand today, the task force has not identified any issue we think would undermine our confidence in the continued safety and emergency planning of nuclear plants in this country,&quot; Charles Miller, an NRC staff member, told the commission in a hearing Thursday on the 30-day briefing.</seg>
<seg id="2460">A full and final 90-day report is due in July.</seg>
<seg id="2461">But nuclear watchdog groups are howling because that regulatory finding comes just two days after a nuclear-industry safety organization, conducting its own safety review, admitted deficiencies at several nuclear power plants – in systems intended to cool reactors in a major emergency.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Then, Wednesday, the NRC issued its own &quot;bulletin&quot; demanding that reactor licensees immediately report, under penalty of perjury, whether they were meeting obligations in that area – the ability to deal with fires and explosions and keep reactors cool even during a station blackout.</seg>
<seg id="2463">Independent nuclear safety experts were left shaking their heads over the seeming contradictions, unable to reconcile the NRC&apos;s all-safe finding with the alerts by industry – and the NRC&apos;s own leap to attention following the industry&apos;s report.</seg>
<seg id="2464">&quot;There&apos;s a lot of confusion right now at the NRC,&quot; says Edwin Lyman, a nuclear physicist and reactor safety expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2465">&quot;What they&apos;re grappling with is really a pretty big gap between regulations they have really good assurance for – those intended to ensure that the plants are operating safely as they are designed for – and those they say can help handle something like Fukushima that&apos;s really beyond the pale.&quot;</seg>

<seg id="2721">Everything Must Go: movie review</seg>
<seg id="2722">In &apos;Everything Must Go,&apos; Will Ferrell portrays a salesman who has just lost his job and been kicked out by his wife.</seg>
<seg id="2723">&quot;Everything Must Go,&quot; starring Will Ferrell, is based on a 1981 Raymond Carver short story called &quot;Why Don&apos;t You Dance?&quot; about a man who, for unclear reasons, has strewn his worldly possessions onto his lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2724">His life, or at least its material contents, becomes a kind of cosmic yard sale.</seg>
<seg id="2725">Carver&apos;s metaphor is all too real in these recessionary times and serves as a springboard for first-time writer-director Dan Rush&apos;s film.</seg>
<seg id="2726">By fleshing out the story, Rush loses Carver&apos;s eerie suggestiveness, the sense of violence percolating beneath the humdrum.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Rush&apos;s literal mindedness about the woes of Ferrell&apos;s Nick Halsey – his wife threw him out, changed the locks, and canceled his credit cards – in some ways feels closer to John Cheever than to Carver. Still, the picture of Nick, beyond zonked, surveying the sum total of his belongings, hits home. It&apos;s powerfully sad.</seg>
<seg id="2728">On the same day that he was thrown out by his wife (whom we never see), Nick, whose drinking has caught up with him, also loses his job as a salesman.</seg>
<seg id="2729">At first, he doesn&apos;t want to do anything about the mess on the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2730">He can&apos;t bear to part with any of it – the furniture, the blenders, the sporting goods, the old LPs, the high school yearbooks.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Rush draws on the intense attachment we can feel for the mundane objects in our lives.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For Nick, these things are talismans from a past that promised a lot more than it delivered.</seg>
<seg id="2733">There&apos;s a wonderful sequence where he reads a flowery inscription in his senior high school yearbook from a girl and then tracks her down.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Delilah (Laura Dern), now a single mother, is still living in the same suburban Phoenix neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2735">Their brief, awkward meeting is remarkably underplayed.</seg>
<seg id="2736">Nick doesn&apos;t open up to her about his predicament and she doesn&apos;t pry, but she knows he&apos;s hurting.</seg>
<seg id="2737">She tells him, &quot;You have a good heart and that doesn&apos;t change,&quot; and she&apos;s right. Nick at that moment is brought back to the person he was – and, deep down, still is.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Ferrell has rarely attempted serious – or in this case, seriocomic – roles.</seg>
<seg id="2739">When he has, as in &quot;Stranger Than Fiction,&quot; he often seems underpowered, as if, in zapping his comic side, he neutralized what was most original about him as a performer.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But because Nick is so benumbed by his predicament, Ferrell&apos;s deadpan makes sense here.</seg>
<seg id="2741">When it cracks – especially in the scene with Delilah, or in the sequences involving Samantha (the wonderful Rebecca Hall), a pregnant young photographer who has moved in across the street – you can see the sorrow and the anger that the blankness was covering up.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Perhaps because he was worried that the film might seem too static and underpopulated, Rush works in a few too many moments involving a sympathetic cop (Michael Peña) and a local kid, Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace, son of the late rapper Notorious B.I.G.).</seg>
<seg id="2743">The cop happens to be Nick&apos;s AA sponsor, which is a bit too convenient, and the boy is a homespun deus ex machina.</seg>
<seg id="2744">Rush wants us to believe that, by ridding himself of his stuff, Nick is liberated.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Given what has come before, this rings false. (Is he also a member of Hoarders Anonymous?) But &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; stays with you anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2746">If there is a single image that we take away from Arthur Miller&apos;s &quot;Death of a Salesman,&quot; it is of Willy Loman weighted down to his very soul by his suitcases.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The image that holds in this modern-day salesman&apos;s serenade is Nick the salesman reduced to selling off his own life. Grade: B+</seg>

<seg id="2748">Countries facing double burden with chronic and infectious diseases</seg>
<seg id="2749">13 May 2011 – An increasing number of countries face a double burden of disease as the prevalence of risk factors for chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart diseases and cancers increase and many nations still struggle to reduce maternal and child deaths caused by infectious diseases, according to a United Nations statistical health report released today.</seg>
<seg id="2750">&quot;This evidence really shows that no country in the world can address health from either an infectious disease perspective or a non-communicable disease one.</seg>
<seg id="2751">Everyone must develop a health system that addresses the full range of the health threats in both areas,&quot; said the director of the World Health Organization&apos;s (WHO) Department of Health Statistics and Informatics, Ties Boerma.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Based on more than 100 health indicators reported by WHO&apos;s 193 Member States and other reliable sources, the WHO&apos;s World Health Statistics 2011 is an annual report which provides a snapshot of the global health situation and key trends.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The 2011 report finds that non-communicable diseases, such as heart diseases, stroke, diabetes and cancer, now make up two-thirds of all deaths globally, due to the ageing population and the spread of risk factors associated with globalization and urbanization.</seg>
<seg id="2754">The control of risk factors such as tobacco use, sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet and excessive use of alcohol becomes more critical, it says, with the latest WHO figures showing that about four out of 10 men and one in 11 women use tobacco and about one in eight adults is obese.</seg>
<seg id="2755">In addition, many developing countries continue to battle health issues – such as pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria – that are most likely to kill children under the age of five.</seg>
<seg id="2756">In 2009, 40 per cent of all child deaths were among newborns, aged 28 days or less.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The report notes that much more needs to be done to achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of reducing by two thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-five mortality rate – but progress has accelerated.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Child mortality declined at 2.7 per cent per year since 2000, twice as fast as during the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="2759">Mortality levels among children under five years fell from 12.4 million in 1990 to 8.1 million in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2760">Maternal mortality declined at 3.3 per cent per year since 2000, almost twice as fast in the decade after 2000 than during the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The report also shows that more money is being spent on health and people can expect to live longer, with life expectancy in 2009 at 68 years, up from 64 years in 1990.</seg>
<seg id="2762">But the gap in health spending between low- and high-income countries remains very large.</seg>
<seg id="2763">In low-income countries, per capita, health expenditure is an estimated $32, or 5.4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), and in high-income countries it is $4,590, or 11 per cent of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="2764">High-income countries have, per capita, on average 10 times more doctors, 12 times more nurses and midwives and 30 times more dentists than low-income countries.</seg>
<seg id="2765">Virtually all deliveries of babies in high-income countries are attended by skilled health personnel; but this is the case for only 40 per cent of deliveries in low-income countries.</seg>
<seg id="2766">WHO&apos;s release of its World Health Statistics 2011 coincided with the launch of its Global Health Observatory, a new website that serves as a one-stop shop for data and analyses on health priorities around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2767">WHO said the observatory provides easy access to the world&apos;s largest and most comprehensive collection of health data, bringing together the organization&apos;s data from all major health and disease programmes.</seg>

<seg id="2768">Three cities win UN-backed award for innovation in disaster risk reduction</seg>
<seg id="2769">12 May 2011 – Cities in the Philippines, Argentina and Canada have won United Nations-backed awards for their efforts to strengthen disaster preparedness, the UN office tasked with assisting countries strengthen disaster risk reduction has announced.</seg>
<seg id="2770">San Francisco in the Philippines, Santa Fe in Argentina and Canada&apos;s District of North Vancouver were declared winners of the UN-Sasakawa Award for Disaster Risk Reduction at a ceremony held last night on the sidelines of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction in Geneva.</seg>
<seg id="2771">San Francisco, a small coastal city in the Philippines prone to typhoons, won $25,000, earning the accolade for its innovative use of the &quot;Purok system,&quot; a traditional method of self-organization within villages where members voluntarily contribute money to bank account for to help those in need of emergency funds after a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="2772">Mobile telephones and radios are used to disseminate information and risk assessments, with Purok coordinators acting as couriers of information to residents.</seg>
<seg id="2773">One of two cities receiving $12,500 was Santa Fe, an Argentine city frequently hit by floods and recognized for effectively communicating disaster risks to the public.</seg>
<seg id="2774">In areas of the city where many people live in informal settlements, authorities have been able to formalize their settlement by giving them land occupancy permits, debt cancellation certificates and sale contracts for their homes.</seg>
<seg id="2775">Scores of families in zones not protected by flood embankments have been relocated.</seg>
<seg id="2776">The District of North Vancouver, which experienced a landslide in 2005, also received $12,500.</seg>
<seg id="2777">Mayor Richard Walton impressed delegates at the Global Platform with his presentation on the city&apos;s GIS (Geographic Information System) website, where the public can access mapping, census, land, environmental, zoning, buildings and other valuable information that is stored in the district&apos;s GIS.</seg>
<seg id="2778">The city&apos;s stated goal is to provide &quot;as much information where possible to our community.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="2779">Mr. Walton told the UN News Centre that the information gathered through the use of the GIS on the land and buildings in the area had enabled engineers to identify 30 properties that needed remedial measures to make them less vulnerable in the event of another landslide or similar disaster.</seg>
<seg id="2780">&quot;We have been able to determine levels of risk, risk tolerance levels, and take mitigation action,&quot; he said.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Other innovations cited were the city of Bhubaneswar in India and Pakistan&apos;s Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA), a Government initiative supported by the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), which both received a letter of recommendation.</seg>
<seg id="2782">The Coordination Centre for Natural Disaster Prevention in Central America, CEPREDENAC, based in Guatemala, received a letter of merit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">&quot;Each of the finalists have had a history of engaging in disaster risk reduction regardless of whether it was fashionable at the time or not,&quot; said Margareta Wahlström, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction and head of the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR).</seg>
<seg id="2784">&quot;Remarkably, they continued to engage in it even if funding was scarce, demonstrating their durability and a sense of innovation and commitment about how to make disaster risk reduction work even with limited resources,&quot; she added.</seg>
<seg id="2785">The UN Sasakawa Award for Disaster Reduction is one of three prizes established in 1986 by the founding chairman of the Nippon Foundation, Ryoichi Sasakawa, a Japanese businessman and philanthropist.</seg>
<seg id="2786">The others are the UN World Health Organization&apos;s (WHO) Sasakawa Health Prize and the UN Environment Programme&apos;s (UNEP) Sasakawa Environment Prize.</seg>

<seg id="2846">GEORGE TOWN, Malaysia - A Penang-born nurse, who was elected as mayor of Colchester, has made her three siblings proud of her achievement.</seg>
<seg id="2847">Helen Chuah, 61, who was Colchester Council&apos;s deputy mayor for the past year, was recently promoted to mayor.</seg>
<seg id="2848">She is said to be the first mayor in England who was not born in Britain.</seg>
<seg id="2849">Her brother Kean Huat, 60, when contacted in Kuala Lumpur, said he had sent a congratulatory card to Helen as he was unable to attend the installation ceremony tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="2850">&quot;None of us can attend the ceremony, including our 62-year-old eldest sister in Teluk Kumbar,&quot; he said.</seg>
<seg id="2851">Helen&apos;s other brother, Kean Chee, 58, a retiree staying in Bukit Jambul, said his sister&apos;s enthusiasm in charity work had been a source of inspiration for his two sons.</seg>
<seg id="2852">&quot;We all still have a close relationship although she has been staying in Britain for the past 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="2853">&quot;She maintains her ties with Malaysia by coming back every year,&quot; he said.</seg>
<seg id="2854">In fact, Helen visited her former school, St George&apos;s Girls School, two months ago and impressed the principal Shariffah Afifah Syed Abbas.</seg>
<seg id="2855">Recalling her meeting, Shariffah Afifah said Helen, who left the school in 1967, was a humble and outstanding person.</seg>
<seg id="2856">&quot;She told me that she is willing to assist and welcome any of our students going to Britain.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="2857">Helen&apos;s story also attracted the attention of Malaysia-born Westminster City Council Chinese Community liaison officer David Tan, who said he was happy to hear the news.</seg>

<seg id="2858">Scientists find genetic link to depression</seg>
<seg id="2859">Scientists say they have discovered the first solid evidence that variations in some peoples&apos; genes may cause depression -- one of the world&apos;s most common and costly mental illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="2860">And in a rare occurrence in genetic research, a British-led international team&apos;s finding of a DNA region linked to depression has been replicated by another team from the United States who were studying an entirely separate group of people.</seg>
<seg id="2861">&quot;What&apos;s remarkable is that both groups found exactly the same region in two separate studies,&quot; Pamela Madden, who led the U.S. team at Washington University, said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="2862">The researchers said they hoped the findings would bring scientists closer to developing more effective treatments for patients with depression, since currently available medicines for depression only work in around half of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2863">&quot;These findings ... will help us track down specific genes that are altered in people with this disease,&quot; said Gerome Breen of King&apos;s College London&apos;s Institute of Psychiatry, who led the other research group.</seg>
<seg id="2864">The researchers said they believed many genes were involved in depression.</seg>
<seg id="2865">These findings are unlikely to benefit patients immediately, with any new drugs developed from them likely to take another 10 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2866">However, they will help scientists understand what may be happening at the genetic and molecular levels in people with depression.</seg>
<seg id="2867">The first study analyzed more 800 families with recurrent depression, while the second examined depression and heavy smoking in a series of families from Australia and Finland.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Both studies were published in the American Journal of Psychiatry on Monday and both teams reported a strong link between depression and genetic variations in a region called chromosome 3p25-26.</seg>
<seg id="2869">&quot;Normally in genetic studies of depression, replication of findings is very difficult and frequently takes years to emerge, if ever,&quot; said Breen, who gave a briefing in London about the work.</seg>
<seg id="2870">Major depression affects about 20 percent of people at some point in their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2871">Severe and recurring depression affects up to 4 percent of people and is notoriously hard to treat.</seg>
<seg id="2872">The World Health Organization has forecast that depression will rival heart disease as the health disorder with the highest disease burden in the world by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="2873">According to a 2006 study, depression is responsible for 100 million lost working days a year in England and Wales alone at a cost of 9 billion pounds (US$14.6 billion).</seg>
<seg id="2874">Studies of families with depression have indicated that the disorder has a genetic link and scientists think around 40 percent of the risk of developing it is contributed by genes, with the rest down to environmental and other external factors.</seg>
<seg id="2875">&quot;We are just beginning to make our way through the maze of influences on depression and this is an important step toward understanding what may be happening at the genetic and molecular levels,&quot; Michele Pergadia, who worked on Washington University study, said in a statement about the findings.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Breen&apos;s team is now conducting detailed gene sequencing studies in 40 of the families involved in the first study to try to find specific genes and variations that show a link.</seg>

<seg id="2877">Passengers Kenlie Tiggeman and Joan Charpentier told by Southwest they were &apos;too fat to fly&apos;</seg>
<seg id="2878">AN airline has apologised to two passengers who were banned from their flight for being &quot;too fat&quot; but then told they could board on one condition: they had to sit next to another overweight person.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Kenlie Tiggeman and her mother Joan Charpentier were on a stopover at Dallas Airport, US, last month when the incident occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2880">As they waited for their flight a Southwest employee allegedly told them that they were &quot;too fat to fly&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="2881">The conversation developed into a 45-minute confrontation - in front of other passengers - over the airline&apos;s weight restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Tiggeman, who has lost 55 kilograms in the last two years, said that she was humiliated by the incident.</seg>
<seg id="2883">She said that she was bemused by the ban as she is able to sit in any airline seat with the armrests down &quot;without encroaching on the seat next to me&quot; and can place the tray table down comfortably.</seg>
<seg id="2884">&quot;I know that I have a lot of weight to lose but I am definitely not too fat to fly,&quot; Ms Tiggeman said.</seg>
<seg id="2885">&quot;I do it all the time, domestically and internationally, and I have never had anyone approach me and particularly in the way that they did. I was embarrassed, humiliated.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="2886">Eventually the pair were told they could board the flight - but only if they sat with a third overweight woman in a row.</seg>
<seg id="2887">&quot;I agreed to do it though my mother and the other woman, Barbara, said that it was ridiculous to suggest that we pay for tickets and not sit where we wanted to sit on an open boarding flight,&quot; she said.</seg>
<seg id="2888">&quot;Barbara prefers to sit at the back of the plane while my mother prefers to sit close to the front.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="2889">A supervisor intervened and told the women they could board the flight without purchasing extra seats.</seg>
<seg id="2890">They were given vouchers and an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2891">Ms Tiggeman received an offer of additional free flights after detailing the ordeal on her blog.</seg>
<seg id="2892">However, having been on over 50 flight in the last few years without incident, she said simply wants the airline to adjust its &quot;sensitivity levels&quot;.</seg>

<seg id="2893">One Death Provides New Life for Many</seg>
<seg id="2894">Mirtala Garcia laid a hand on Sebastiao Lourenco&apos;s chest, then pressed her ear there for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="2895">Organ Recipients&quot;That&apos;s my heart,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s still beating for me.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="2896">Although she had just met Mr. Lourenco, she had known his heart for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It had belonged to her husband, Julio, who died from a brain hemorrhage in March 2010, at the age of 38.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Mrs. Garcia donated her husband&apos;s organs, and the family&apos;s loss led to a second chance for Mr. Lourenco, 57.</seg>
<seg id="2899">But he was not the only one.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Seven or eight other people who urgently needed transplants also received organs from Mr. Garcia, an unusually large number. (The average from organ donors is about three.)</seg>
<seg id="2901">Even more unusual, his family and a group of recipients met on Wednesday in a highly emotional gathering at the Manhattan headquarters of the New York Organ Donor Network, which coordinated the transplants.</seg>
<seg id="2902">The story of the Garcias and the people whose lives were saved by one man&apos;s donated organs provides a close look at the charged world of transplants and organ donation, where people on the transplant list know they may die waiting, and the families of brain-dead patients are asked, at perhaps the most painful time in their lives, to look beyond their own grief and allow a loved one&apos;s organs to be removed to help strangers.</seg>
<seg id="2903">There are nowhere near enough donor organs for all the people who need transplants.</seg>
<seg id="2904">Nearly 111,000 are on waiting lists in the United States, but last year, only 28,663 transplants were performed, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, which oversees the transplant system nationwide.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This year, 6,000 to 7,000 people are expected to die waiting.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Last week, Mrs. Garcia and her children, 5, 11 and 18, who all live in Stamford, Conn., met four of the recipients of her husband&apos;s organs for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2907">A fifth recipient also attended, one of two people with renal failure, both members of the Garcias&apos; church, whom Mrs. Garcia chose to receive kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2908">Mrs. Garcia addressed a room packed with recipients, families, doctors, nurses, her minister and his family and network employees.</seg>
<seg id="2909">She spoke briefly through an interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="2910">She said her husband had had a big heart and would be very proud &quot;to give life after death.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="2911">No one would ever forget him, she said.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Elaine R. Berg, president of the donor network, said: &quot;These meetings don&apos;t happen that frequently. I&apos;ve been here 11 years, and if it&apos;s once a year that&apos;s a lot. I&apos;ve never met five recipients from one donor. It&apos;s highly unusual.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="2913">In many cases recipients or donor families, or both, choose to remain anonymous, Ms. Berg said.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Recipients may send thank-you letters through the network, but they and donors do not often choose to meet.</seg>
<seg id="2915">&quot;It&apos;s pretty intimidating and pretty emotional,&quot; Ms. Berg said. &quot;Some people cannot bear it.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="2916">But she said that meeting the recipients can bring solace to donor families.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="2917">Not Releasing bin Laden Death Photo Is Smart</seg>
<seg id="2918">It was inevitable, with the emergence and escalation of the &quot;birther&quot; campaign, that we would experience the same bizarre skepticism when it comes to Osama bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="2919">If there are a group of conspiracy theorists who insist on seeing proof of U.S. birth for President Obama, is it any surprise that there would be a concurrent call for proof of death for bin Laden?</seg>
<seg id="2920">President Obama has decided not to release a photo of the dead bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="2921">True, it would perhaps appease those who don&apos;t really believe that the U.S. military and intelligence personnel, under Obama&apos;s direction, completed the task of killing the hated bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="2922">But releasing a photo or video could also rally terrorist forces around the world, buttressing any movement to turn bin Laden into a martyr.</seg>
<seg id="2923">We&apos;ve become unfortunately accustomed to a YouTube, reality TV, cell phone photo approach to living--a world where privacy and dignity are sacrificed for hyper-transparency and more commonly, pure voyeurism.</seg>
<seg id="2924">But images matter, and sending provocative images or videos around the world can have a destructive effect.</seg>
<seg id="2925">The Internet posting of a video showing the burning of a Koran in Florida is one such example, giving amplified attention to a local pastor whose narrow-mindedness and ignorance does not deserve to be promoted.</seg>
<seg id="2926">What would be the purpose of releasing a photo?</seg>
<seg id="2927">Would it really reassure Americans that bin Laden is really dead?</seg>
<seg id="2928">Or would it just provoke a new wave of conspiracy theories about doctored photos and lies?</seg>
<seg id="2929">There are people, remarkably, who still don&apos;t believe Obama was born in Hawaii, despite indisputable evidence to the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Why would a picture of a dead bin Laden be any more effective?</seg>
<seg id="2931">At best, it would give some satisfaction to those of us who want to see the face of hate bloodied and lifeless.</seg>
<seg id="2932">At worst, it will incite would-be terrorists around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2933">And at its heart, the demand for pictures of a deceased bin Laden are not much different from the demands for further proof of Obama&apos;s domestic birth.</seg>
<seg id="2934">In both cases, we are dealing with people who simply cannot believe that a mixed-race man became president, and further, will refuse to believe he could have accomplished something so great.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The Obama haters will believe what they want to believe, regardless of what is shown them.</seg>
<seg id="2936">Releasing photos won&apos;t change their minds.</seg>

<seg id="2937">Gunmen on Motorcycles Kill Saudi Diplomat in Pakistan</seg>
<seg id="2938">A Saudi Arabian diplomat was killed on Monday in the volatile southern port city of Karachi, police officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2939">The diplomat, identified as Hassan M. al-Kahtani, was shot by gunmen riding two motorcycles who intercepted his vehicle after he left his home in an upscale neighborhood, the officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2940">There was no immediate claim of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2941">&quot;He was shot in the head and died on the spot,&quot; said a police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Police officials said they were investigating motives and did not rule out the possibility that the killing might have been retribution for the May 2 killing of Osama bin Laden by Navy Seal commandos in the military garrison town of Abbottabad, a few hours&apos; drive from Islamabad, the capital.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Saudi Arabia&apos;s rulers have long expressed their antipathy toward Bin Laden, the Al Qaeda leader and plotter of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, who came from a wealthy Saudi family.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Officials said the attack on the Saudi diplomat might also have been related to Saudi Arabia&apos;s effort to suppress antigovernment protests in Bahrain.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Two months ago Saudi Arabia deployed forces in Bahrain, its smaller neighbor, to help the Sunni-minority rulers there suppress demonstrations by members of the Shiite majority.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Last Wednesday, unidentified assailants threw firecrackers at the Saudi Consulate, but there were no injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2947">A Pakistani security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Saudi diplomat was an intelligence official.</seg>
<seg id="2948">&quot;He was looking into Saudi dissidents who have found refuge in the city, and this is most probably why he was targeted,&quot; the official said.</seg>
<seg id="2949">Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have traditionally been close allies, and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, the political party that controls Karachi, described the killing as an effort to destabilize relations between the two.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Karachi, considered Pakistan&apos;s financial and commercial hub, is a city torn by political and sectarian unrest.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Ikram Sehgal, a defense analyst based in Karachi, said the attack would not affect relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="2952">He also said the killing underlined the fragile security situation there.</seg>
<seg id="2953">&quot;There are several militant groups that are acting independently in the city,&quot; Mr. Sehgal said. &quot;There are a lot of soft targets.&quot;</seg>

<seg id="3099">Fast-Tracking to Kindergarten?</seg>
<seg id="3100">&quot;Is that how we write a 12?&quot; her instructor, Maria Rivas, asks. &quot;Erase it.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3101">&quot;This is a sloppy 12, Eze,&quot; she says. &quot;Go ahead: a one and a two. Smaller. Much better.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3102">Eze moves to 13.</seg>
<seg id="3103">&quot;Neater,&quot; Ms. Rivas insists.</seg>
<seg id="3104">&quot;Come on, you can do it.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3105">Finally, she resorts to the kind of incentive that Eze, her pink glitter sneaker barely grazing the ground, can appreciate: &quot;You&apos;ll get an extra sticker if you can do a perfect 13.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3106">Eze is 3.</seg>
<seg id="3107">She is neither problem child nor prodigy.</seg>
<seg id="3108">And her mother, Gina Goldman, who watches through a glass window from the waiting room, says drilling numbers and letters into the head of a 3-year-old defies all the warmth and coziness of her parenting philosophy -- as well as the ethos of Eze&apos;s progressive preschool.</seg>
<seg id="3109">But she began bringing Eze and her older brother to these tutoring sessions nearly a year ago on the advice of a friend, and has since become the kind of believer who is fueling a rapid expansion of Junior Kumon preschool enrichment programs like this one, a block from the toddler-swollen playgrounds of Battery Park City.</seg>
<seg id="3110">As competition in education has spread down, the tutoring industry has followed.</seg>
<seg id="3111">Research suggests that there is little benefit from this kind of tutoring; that young children learn just as much about math, if not more, fitting mixing bowls together on the kitchen floor.</seg>
<seg id="3112">But programs like Kumon are gaining from, and generating, parents&apos; anxiety about what kind of preparation their children will need -- and whether parents themselves have what it takes to provide it.</seg>
<seg id="3113">For those whose idea of enrichment is introducing &quot;Buenas Noches, Luna&quot; into their toddlers&apos; bedtime reading ritual, this is yet another reminder that no matter how much you do, there is always some other program that -- who knows? -- just might mean a difference.</seg>
<seg id="3114">&quot;The best you can say is that they&apos;re useless,&quot; said Alison Gopnik, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, who compared the escalation of supplemental education with Irish elk competing to see which had the biggest antlers.</seg>
<seg id="3115"> &quot;The result is that they go around tottering, unable to walk, under the enormous weight of these antlers they&apos;ve developed,&quot; she said.</seg>
<seg id="3116"> &quot;I think it&apos;s true of American parents from high school all the way down to preschool.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3117">Other tutoring companies like Sylvan have also moved into the prekindergarten market.</seg>
<seg id="3118">But Kumon, a Japanese import that calls itself the world&apos;s largest math and reading enrichment program, has pushed most aggressively, admitting students as young as 2.</seg>
<seg id="3119">Those young students have become an increasingly important part of its business: Kumon grew by about 12 percent last year, to 250,000 students nationwide; Junior Kumon grew by more than 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="3120">In New York, where the company is colonizing storefronts like so many Starbucks, enrollment in Junior Kumon has tripled since it began opening centers in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="3121">&quot;Age 3 is the sweet spot,&quot; said Joseph Nativo, chief financial officer for Kumon North America.</seg>
<seg id="3122">&quot;But if they&apos;re out of a diaper and can sit still with a Kumon instructor for 15 minutes, we will take them.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3123">While worksheets are considered soul sapping in the schools where many Junior Kumon parents aspire to send their children -- the kind of affluent places holding screenings of &quot;Race to Nowhere&quot; -- at Kumon, they are the essence of the experience.</seg>
<seg id="3124">Repetition, derided elsewhere as drill and kill, is considered the key to developing concentration.</seg>
<seg id="3125">PARENTS pay $200 to $300 a month for their 2-, 3-, 4- or 5-year-old to spend up to an hour twice weekly being tutored at a Junior Kumon center -- 20 to 30 minutes each on reading and math.</seg>
<seg id="3126">Children are then expected to do 20 minutes of homework on each subject every day, with their parents guiding and grading them.</seg>
<seg id="3127">Recommended reading lists start in preschool with &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; and &quot;Each Peach Pear Plum.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3128">Ms. Goldman, who works at an agency representing artists, took her son, Huxton, to Kumon last September, shortly after he turned 5, in an effort to make sure, she said, &quot;that he wouldn&apos;t be behind the curve&quot; when he started kindergarten the next year.</seg>
<seg id="3129">If she was hesitant, her children&apos;s preschool was &quot;disgusted,&quot; she said.</seg>
<seg id="3130">But she saw immediate results -- Huxton began reading, adding and subtracting -- and Eze, newly 3, started soon after.</seg>
<seg id="3131">&quot;These results translated into a self-esteem boost that I didn&apos;t anticipate,&quot; Ms. Goldman said.</seg>
<seg id="3132">&quot;They&apos;ve gotten that there&apos;s a thrill in achieving something. I care more about that than I care about them reading.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3133">She liked that it required her to participate in her children&apos;s homework.</seg>
<seg id="3134">&quot;I treat them both with more respect now, because I see what they&apos;re capable of intellectually,&quot; she said.</seg>
<seg id="3135">And she liked that it was reward-based, even as she recognizes that some experts decry using prizes as incentives to learn.</seg>
<seg id="3136">&quot;That&apos;s life,&quot; she said. &quot;If you do something, you get something.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3137">Now, as she considers what extracurricular activities to keep on their schedule (her children also take swimming, karate, music, art and German classes), Ms. Goldman said she would not think of giving up Kumon.</seg>
<seg id="3138">&quot;It used to seem like a horrible thing to do to your kid -- why would you force this?&quot; she said.</seg>
<seg id="3139">&quot;I don&apos;t feel that way anymore.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3140">Officials at Kumon say it is often thought of as an &quot;Asian&quot; program -- a description they reject.</seg>
<seg id="3141">There is no competition or pressure, they say; everyone gets a perfect score on the worksheets because they are given countless opportunities to correct themselves.</seg>
<seg id="3142">But Junior Kumon has proven popular among many accomplished immigrant parents.</seg>
<seg id="3143">Estee Bauernebel, who grew up in Australia of Korean, Japanese, Chinese and Malaysian heritage, took Kumon classes herself as a child.</seg>
<seg id="3144">Seeing the education her son was getting in a public elementary school &quot;was heartbreaking,&quot; she said.</seg>
<seg id="3145">&quot;In Australia they&apos;re doing basic multiplication in first grade.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3146">She enrolled him first, at 7, and then her daughter, Mia, at 3, after she became jealous of her brother&apos;s homework -- a not uncommon story at Junior Kumon centers.</seg>
<seg id="3147">&quot;She used to cry at night because she couldn&apos;t read,&quot; Ms. Bauernebel said.</seg>
<seg id="3148">&quot;It was so traumatic for all of us.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3149">Kumon officials say they had always allowed preschoolers into the programs.</seg>
<seg id="3150">But about 10 years ago, they repackaged and began marketing it as Junior Kumon.</seg>
<seg id="3151">&quot;People sometimes believed ‘my kids are too young,&apos; &quot; said Mr. Nativo, the chief financial officer.</seg>
<seg id="3152">&quot;We highlighted the fact that the earlier you start, the better.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3153">The company created additional flash cards aimed at younger children, and altered the setup of the centers.</seg>
<seg id="3154">While students in older Kumon programs work independently at tables set up in rows, Junior Kumon students sit around horseshoe-shaped tables, overseen by &quot;assistants&quot; -- they are never called teachers.</seg>
<seg id="3155">The company installed windows between the parents&apos; waiting rooms and the Junior Kumon rooms, to ease any separation anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="3156">&quot;The Junior Kumon program is the anchor of our center,&quot; said Amy DeBock, who owns a franchise in South Grafton, Mass., that serves the affluent communities surrounding it.</seg>
<seg id="3157">&quot;The students who do well in Junior Kumon, they will continue and continue and continue with the program.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3158">She was concerned when the economy collapsed that parents would pull their children out.</seg>
<seg id="3159">But she has seen no dropoff.</seg>
<seg id="3160">&quot;I really think parents will get rid of everything else but education for their children,&quot; she said.</seg>
<seg id="3161">&quot;With all the information coming out about the competition and the push on education, especially in our area, parents are just wanting their children to have the best, to be ahead.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3162">Most Kumon centers are franchises.</seg>
<seg id="3163">But recognizing the prohibitive costs of rent in New York City, the parent company began opening centers itself in New York City a little over three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3164">It now has 36 in the five boroughs -- 13 in Manhattan -- with 14 more expected to open this year.</seg>
<seg id="3165">At the Battery Park City center, students walk in with a sense of purpose, carrying light-blue pouches with their homework.</seg>
<seg id="3166">They check in on an attendance sheet and search out their folders with new worksheets, then sit down and take out their pencils.</seg>
<seg id="3167">For the uninitiated -- not to mention anyone with small children -- a visit to Junior Kumon can be unnerving.</seg>
<seg id="3168">Little Kate Wattenberg, a 6-year-old who recently graduated from Junior Kumon, has just finished 90 multiplication problems in six minutes.</seg>
<seg id="3169">As she prepares to check out for the day, she shows the center&apos;s director, Diana Sutowski, the entry in her reading journal for the last book she read, &quot;Knights in Shining Armor.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3170">&quot;I liked that he did become a knight because he practiced a lot,&quot; she had written.</seg>
<seg id="3171">&quot;Can you tell me what the future tense of practice is?&quot; Ms. Sutowski asks.</seg>
<seg id="3172">&quot;I will practice,&quot; Kate says.</seg>
<seg id="3173">&quot;The past tense?&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3174">&quot;Past is it already happened,&quot; Kate thinks aloud. &quot;I practiced.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3175">Before she leaves, Ms. Sutowski congratulates her with a high five.</seg>
<seg id="3176">Kate&apos;s mother, Jessica, brought her to Junior Kumon because, she said: &quot;I do try to follow education, and I am scared for the future of our country. These children are going to be central to our social security, to our political decisions.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3177">Like most students at Kumon, Kate comes from a background where she is likely to get plenty of educational stimulation and sophistication -- when Ms. Wattenberg tells her daughters that they are going home to make pizza with a friend that evening, Kate&apos;s younger sister, 4, cheers, &quot;I want pesto!&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3178">Many who study child development say that that kind of exposure -- to parents who use big vocabulary words and bring books into the house -- is the best preparation for a young child, and question how much programs like Junior Kumon really help.</seg>
<seg id="3179">Parents and policy makers may be ambivalent, Professor Gopnik said, but the popularity of programs like Kumon is &quot;pushing very young children&apos;s lives and curriculum in preschool programs more and more in this direction.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3180">&quot;Part of them are saying, ‘This isn&apos;t right, 3-year-olds should be playing in the sandbox and putting together mixing bowls,&apos; but then they&apos;re thinking that maybe if the kid next door is doing it, it&apos;ll be time to go to Harvard and my child won&apos;t have the same advantage,&quot; she said.</seg>
<seg id="3181">&quot;We are in a culture where education is the path to success, and it&apos;s hard for people to recognize how deep and profound learning is when children are just playing.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3182">&quot;When you&apos;re putting blocks together, you&apos;re learning how to be a physicist,&quot; agreed Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, a psychologist at Temple University and an author of &quot;Einstein Never Used Flash Cards.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3183">&quot;When you&apos;re learning how to balance things and calculate how tall you can make your building, you&apos;re learning how to be a physicist. Having your kid drill and kill and fill in worksheets at 2 and 3 and 4 to the best of our knowledge so far does not give your child a leg up on anything.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3184">&quot;Yes, your child might know more of his letters than the child who spent Saturday in the sandbox,&quot; she said.</seg>
<seg id="3185">&quot;But the people who are team players, who are creative innovators, they are the ones who are going to invent the next iPad. The kids who are just memorizing are going to be outsourced to the kids in India who have memorized the same stuff.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3186">Programs like Junior Kumon may not do harm, she said.</seg>
<seg id="3187">But they do help push a consensus that young children need more and more structured curriculum.</seg>
